It works fine
It works well
Just a minute
Just be quiet
Just leave it
Just trust me
Keep in touch

Life is sweet
Lock the door
Look up there
Love is blind
Luck is blind
Make a choice
Make it quick
Make your bed
Man is mortal
Mary is weird
Men never cry
My foot hurts
Never give up
Nobody got up
Nobody saw me
Now means now
Open the door
Open the safe

Please fix it
Please get in

Bring me my cane
Bring them to me
Climb to the top
Come and help us
Come run with me
Come sit with us
Come with me now
Cookie is my dog
Do as you please
Do it right away
Do not come here
Do what you like
Do what you want
Drinks are on me
Explain it to me
Get away from me
Get back to work
Get into the car
Get on the horse
Get on your bike
Get on your feet
Get out of there
Get to the point
Give me a chance
Give me a hammer
Give me a minute
Give me a second
Give me my drink
Give me the ball
Give me the book
Give me your gun
Give them to her
Give them to him
Give us a minute
Go back to sleep
Go have some fun
Go on without me
Go play with Tom
Go to the barber
Go up the stairs
Go when you want
Go with the flow
Grow up a little
Hang on a minute
Hang on a second
Have a good time
Have a nice time
Have a nice trip
Have a safe trip
He became a hobo
He blew the deal
He broke the law
He can swim fast
He can swim well
He caught a cold
He cheated on me
He cleaned it up
He cried for joy
He eats too much
He fed the horse
He fixed the net
He flew to Paris
He found my bike
He gets up early
He had gray hair
He had long hair
He has a Picasso
He has a bicycle
He has been busy
He has big hands
He has long legs
He has no choice
He has the Joker
He heard a noise
He heard a shout
He is an acrobat
He is dead drunk
He is doing well
He is her friend
He is in pajamas
He is in trouble
He is my brother
He is my teacher
He is never lazy
He is not stupid
He is still here
He is very angry
He is very brave
He is very young
He keeps a diary
He kept his word
He knows his job
He knows my wife
He laughed at me
He left after me
He left his wife
He likes to hunt
He made no reply
He meant no harm
He must be tired
He must love you
He must not live
He needs a towel
He painted a dog
He ran into debt
He ratted us out
He saved my life
He shall have it
He shares a room
He shut the door
He slept all day
He slept an hour
He took his book
He took his time
He used his head
He wants to come
He was all wrong
He was born rich
He was in France
He was very poor
He went far away
He will be ready
Help me out here
Her hair is long
Here is the bill
Here is your bag
Here is your dog
Here is your key
Hold on a minute
I agree with him
I agree with you
I already did it
I am a foreigner
I am a housewife
I am a masochist
I am a professor
I am a volunteer
I am an American
I am cooking now
I am from Brazil
I am from France
I am from Russia
I am frying fish
I am not kidding
I am only joking
I am paid weekly
I am pretty sure
I am truly sorry
I began to speak
I began to sweat
I believe in God
I believe in him
I believe in you
I bought a house
I bought a watch
I brought a book
I called him Tom
I caught the flu
I could kiss you
I could see that
I did it already
I did it quickly
I do believe you
I drank the wine
I drink to relax
I drive a hybrid
I feel all right
I feel bad today
I feel safe here
I feel so pretty
I feel so stupid
I feel very cold
I feel very sick
I feel your pain
I forgot the map
I found it there
I found my shoes
I found your cap
I got home first
I got paid today
I got really mad
I guess we could
I had a headache
I had my reasons
I hate my sister
I hate that book
I hate that idea
I hate that song
I hate this game
I hate this song
I hate this town
I hate your guts
I have a bicycle
I have a diploma
I have a grenade
I have a problem
I have a receipt
I have asked him
I have been busy
I have few books
I have hay fever
I have no choice
I have no excuse
I have no family
I have one child
I have some food
I have some time
I have sore feet
I have to change
I have two books
I hope you agree
I just got fired
I just love that
I just opened it
I kicked the dog
I knew the risks
I know it myself
I know only this
I know the drill
I know the truth
I know this song
I know your face
I know your name
I know your type
I left a message
I like fresh air
I like her novel
I like math best
I like that song
I like the beach
I like these two
I like this book
I like this game
I like this room
I like this song
I like to travel
I like your city
I like your hair
I lit the candle
I live in Boston
I live in Tahiti
I live next door
I lost my camera
I lost my temper
I lost my wallet
I lost the watch
I love my family
I love my mother
I love old books
I love soul food
I love that idea
I love that show
I love that song
I love this game
I love this part
I love this show
I love this song
I love this town
I love your city
I love your eyes
I love your hair
I loved that car
I loved that dog
I loved the play
I made Tom laugh
I made a fortune
I made a mistake
I made a promise
I made a snowman
I made it myself
I met my friends
I might be wrong
I miss you badly
I missed the bus
I must get going
I must leave now
I must warn them
I need a Kleenex
I need a haircut
I need a partner
I need an escort
I need more gold
I need more time
I need new shoes
I need new tires
I need some cash
I need some soap
I need the money
I need to travel
I need your help
I never did that
I never sleep in
I never told Tom
I opened one eye
I own a computer
I own this place
I own this store
I paid the check
I party too much
I planted a tree
I play the piano
I pointed at him
I prefer to read
I prefer to walk
I really am busy
I really hope so
I really mean it
I really need it
I refused to pay
I rubbed my feet
I run this place
I said stay back
I sat beside her
I see your house
I see your point
I seldom see him
I started to cry
I still like Tom
I still love you
I swim every day
I talk to myself
I think Tom died
I think Tom left
I truly hope not
I waited a month
I waited a while
I walk every day
I walk to school
I want a blanket
I want a divorce
I want a martini
I want a rematch
I want a scooter
I want much more
I want some milk
I want that book
I want the facts
I want to retire
I want your love
I wanted to come
I was born there
I was happy then
I was here first
I was quite calm
I was very tired
I washed my feet
I waved him back
I went to school
I will shoot him
I will teach you
I will try again
I wish them luck
I work on Sunday
I worry too much
I wrote the note
It began to snow
It belongs to me
It did the trick
It freaks me out
It hurts so much
It is cloudy now
It is fine today
It is very short
It is your right
It just came out
It looks so real
It made me laugh
It matters a lot
It matters to me
It may rain soon
It must be there
It should be fun
It was a mistake
It was all there
It was all wrong
It was his fault
It was just hype
It was last year
It was very cool
It was very dark
It was very ugly
It was your idea
It will grow old
It worked for me
Just do your job
Just get to work
Just look at him
Keep a cool head
Keep the dog out
Leave that to me
Leave this to me
Let me handle it
Let me repair it
Let me stop here
Let me take that
Let me try again
Live free or die
Look at that dog
Look at this one
Look at your map
Mary is my niece
My boat is small
My eyes are blue
My eyes are sore
My father is out
My feet are cold
My feet get cold
My glass is full
My house is nice
My job is boring
My legs are fine
My mouth is numb
My nose is itchy
My tie is orange
My wife beats me
Never tell a lie
Nice to meet you
No need to worry
No one asked you
No one can leave
No one helped me
No one is amused
No one is around
No one is coming
No one knows why
No one knows yet
No one likes war
No one loves war
No one says that
No one showed up
No one thinks so
No one warned me
No one was alive
No one was there
No one will care
No one will know
No one will talk
Our team can win
Our team may win
Pass me the salt
Pump up the tire
Put on your coat
Rome is in Italy
Say it in French
See you at lunch
She did it again
She died from TB
She does know it
She has dry hair
She has no shame
She has wet hair
She is a pianist
She is a student
She is no beauty
She is not wrong
She is very busy
She is very wise
She just told me
She lost her way
She made a scene
She made him cry
She may not come
She must be sick
She put on socks
She rode a camel
She smokes a lot
She stared at me
She stood by him
She talked a lot
She took my hand
She was in agony
Shut that boy up
Sorry to be late
Stay in your car
Stay out of this
Stop the car now
Take a short cut
Tell Dad to come
Tell Tom to wait
Tell me about it
That book is old
That car is hers
That helps a bit
That helps a lot
That is a pagoda
That is a pencil
That is not true
That is old news
That made me cry
That was so cool
That will not do
The TV is broken
The answer is no
The apple is red
The bird is dead
The book is easy
The book is here
The book is mine
The bus was full
The car is ready
The cat is black
The dog is dying
The dog is white
The dog was dead
The dogs are wet
The food is cold
The game is over
The jury is hung
The light is off
The light is out
The light was on
The line is busy
The man is right
The mass is over
The milk is sour
The night is hot
The pain is gone
The sea is rough
The soup is cold
The switch is on
The tank is full
The water is hot
The water is icy
The well ran dry
There is no hope
These are my CDs
They had no food
They lied to you
They made her go
They took a walk
This and no more
This bed is cold
This book is new
This book is old
This car is fast
This car is mine
This dog is mine
This game is fun
This is a hybrid
This is a pencil
This is an order
This is bad news
This is my coach
This is my horse
This is my house
This is not good
This is not safe
This is not true
This is old news
This is our home
This is so crazy
This is too hard
This is too long
This is your dog
This is your key
This made me sad
This was my idea
Those are my CDs
Tom ate my lunch
Tom can run fast
Tom cooks for us
Tom died at home
Tom died from TB
Tom drinks a lot
Tom had jeans on
Tom has big lips
Tom has red hair
Tom is a monster
Tom is a mystery
Tom is a student
Tom is all alone
Tom is all right
Tom is an intern
Tom is an orphan
Tom is at school
Tom is like that
Tom is my friend
Tom is our guest
Tom is the owner
Tom is too young
Tom killed a man
Tom likes to run
Tom lost his hat
Tom lost his job
Tom lost the bet
Tom needs a bath
Tom swears a lot
Tom took the job
Tom wants a beer
Tom will find it
Tom won the game
Trust me on that
Trust me on this
Try it once more
Try not to laugh
Try not to panic
Try not to worry
Try some of this
Try to calm down
Try to go slower
Try to look busy
Turn to the left
Walk ahead of me
We all have kids
We are not alone
We both love you
We can all dream
We can still win
We depend on you
We do not forget
We found it here
We gave our word
We got too close
We have a theory
We have no money
We have no proof
We have no water
We have to split
We have two ears
We have two kids
We have two sons
We heard a noise
We just got here
We kept our word
We know all this
We know it works
We left by train
We live in peace
We lost the game
We meant no harm
We met last week
We met on Sunday
We must fix this
We must sit down
We need you back
We only want you
We want to leave
We were too late
We will fix this
We will not fail
We wish you luck
We won the match
You all did well
You are a doctor
You are a genius
You are not kind
You are to blame
You are too late
You came at five
You came in late
You can all help
You can go there
You can look now
You can trust me
You can use mine
You did say that
You have a point
You have my word
You have no idea
You have no life
You have to come
You know me well
You know the law
You look so cool
You look so pale
You made Tom cry
You made me late
You make me sick
You may be right
You may go there
You may meet him
You may quote me
You missed a lot
You must tell me
You must tell us
You need a drink
You need to come
You need to rest
You need to stop
You saved us all
You should do it
Your car is fast
Your dog is here
Your face is red
Your room is big
A dog was running
A drunk robbed me
A leaf is falling
Add a little milk
Any paper will do
Be honest with me
Be kind to others
Be nice to others
Boys will be boys
Bring me my shoes
But I was careful
Cocaine is a drug
Come a bit closer
Come here at once
Come into my room
Come play with us
Come to my office
Cows give us milk
Cut off the power
Deal us the cards
Do it by yourself
Do your very best
Earth is a planet
Even my mom knows
Every bus is full
Fill in this form
Get into your car
Get me some water
Get on your knees
Get ready for bed
Give me an orange
Give me five days
Give me some milk
Give me the money
Give me your belt
Give me your hand
Give me your keys
Go ahead and talk
Go get some water
Grab hold of this
Hay is for horses
He asked for food
He asked for help
He began to sweat
He blocked my way
He broke his word
He broke my heart
He called my name
He came back soon
He came in person
He carried a cane
He chewed his gum
He cried with joy
He deals in grain
He did it himself
He did not listen
He died of cancer
He does not smoke
He drank a little
He drives a truck
He dropped a vase
He earns a living
He employs a maid
He fills the bill
He glanced at her
He goes to school
He got very drunk
He got well again
He grabbed my arm
He has a headache
He has blond hair
He has brown eyes
He has curly hair
He has no bicycle
He has no remorse

He hates his life
He helped me move
He himself did it
He is a biologist
He is a daredevil
He is a detective
He is a dramatist
He is a gentleman
He is a physicist
He is a scientist
He is about forty
He is an American
He is beyond help
He is beyond hope
He is getting old
He is in business
He is not married
He is quite right
He is running now
He is still alive
He is still angry
He is teaching me
He is very honest
He is walking now
He is watching TV
He just texted me
He keeps his word
He keeps two cats
He kept it secret
He kept on crying
He knows too much
He left the house
He likes my jokes
He lives close by
He lives in Kyoto
He lives in Osaka
He lives in Tokyo
He looks after us
He lost his honor
He loves to party
He made a mistake
He may come today
He moved to Tokyo
He must find work
He needed to rest
He never asked me
He owns this land
He raised his arm
He raised his hat
He ran five miles
He refused to pay
He ruined my life
He runs very fast
He saved a sailor
He shook his head
He skipped a year
He started to cry
He stayed up late
He stole my heart
He struck a match
He threw the ball
He told the truth
He turned the key
He twisted my arm
He wakes up early
He wants an apple
He wants to speak
He was raging mad
He was tired then
He was very happy
He was wide awake
He went back home
He will be missed
He will come back
He will come soon
He will excuse me
He wore old shoes
He wore red pants
He works at night
He works under me
He wrote a letter
Her eyes are blue
Her nails are red
Here is your book
Here we are again
His eyes are blue
His story is true
I accept the risk
I agreed with Tom
I agreed with her
I almost shot you
I already said no
I also went there
I am a vegetarian
I am almost ready
I am baking bread
I am from England
I am rather happy
I am studying now
I am very curious
I am very pleased
I ate my sandwich
I baited the hook
I barely know you
I bathe every day
I beg your pardon
I bid against him
I bought a hybrid
I bought that car
I bought the book
I broke his heart
I brushed my hair
I called for help
I called the cops
I came from China
I can comfort her
I can handle this
I can hardly swim
I can hardly walk
I can play Chopin
I can play tennis
I can protect you
I changed my mind
I checked my bags
I come from Japan
I could tutor you
I did my homework
I did this myself
I drank the water
I dropped my keys
I feel better now
I feel really bad
I feel safer here
I feel their pain
I feel well today
I felt very happy
I finally gave up
I find that funny
I forgot my scarf
I forgot the book
I found the money
I get good grades
I get the picture
I got first place
I got left behind
I got off lightly
I got soaking wet
I got very sleepy
I had a breakdown
I had a nightmare
I had an accident
I hate being late
I hate my brother
I hate my parents
I hate rainy days
I hate that color
I hate that movie
I hate this music
I hate this place
I hate this store
I hate this thing
I have a backache
I have a computer
I have a daughter
I have a hangover
I have a headache
I have a passport
I have a proposal
I have a question
I have a solution
I have an earache
I have bad breath
I have been loved
I have brown hair
I have many books
I have many discs
I have no comment
I have no friends
I have no privacy
I have no regrets
I have no sisters
I have one sister
I have some gifts
I have some money
I have three dogs
I held his sleeve
I hit the jackpot
I hope that helps
I hope this works
I hope we survive
I just dropped in
I just feel awful
I just gave blood
I just got bitten
I just got tenure
I just ignore Tom
I kept on reading
I know a shortcut
I know his family
I lied about that
I like coffee hot
I like folk songs
I like short hair
I like that shirt
I like that skirt
I like the colors
I like these hats
I like this color
I like this model
I like those odds
I like your beard
I like your dress
I like your house
I like your place
I like your scarf
I like your shoes
I like your smile
I like your style
I liked that book
I liked this book
I liked this film
I lit the candles
I live here alone
I live in comfort

I lost my glasses
I love doing this
I love my country
I love my parents
I love that chair
I love that dress
I love that movie
I love that place
I love that scarf
I love that shirt

I love you anyway
I love you people
I love your dress
I love your house
I love your place
I loved that book
I made a decision
I made you coffee
I may outlive you
I met your friend
I miss my friends
I miss my parents
I miss that place
I miss this place
I missed my train
I missed you kids
I must eat slowly
I need a breather
I need a computer
I need a keyboard
I need an ashtray
I need more light
I need more money
I need more power
I need my privacy
I need some light
I need some paper
I need some sleep
I need some water
I need this money
I needed a change
I never knew that
I never said that
I never went back
I often drink tea
I opened the door
I owe him nothing
I owe you nothing
I paid in advance
I plan on winning
I play the violin
I pulled a muscle
I punched his jaw
I read some books
I really am sorry
I really doubt it
I really hope not
I really like him
I really like you
I really love you
I really miss Tom
I really miss you
I really need you
I remember it now
I rescued the cat
I ripped my pants
I saved your life
I saw him running
I saw the sunrise
I saw you cooking
I saw you outside
I saw your father
I see the problem
I should be happy
I should be there
I should head out
I slept very well
I still have mine
I study at school
I swallowed a bug
I tried to escape
I truly loved her
I usually eat out
I want an apology
I want more money
I want my freedom
I want some paper
I want some water
I want ten plates
I want them alive
I want to confess
I want to workout
I wanted the best
I wanted to fight
I wanted to laugh
I warned you once
I was happy there
I was just joking
I was just mugged
I was not pleased
I was on vacation
I was only joking
I was tired today
I was very hungry
I went on reading
I went to Harvard
I will choose one
I will stay there
I worked with Tom
I worry about him
I wrote that book
I wrote this book
It belongs to Tom
It goes both ways
It has cooled off
It is pretty cold
It is sunny today
It is windy today
It makes no sense
It never gets old
It rained all day
It sure scared me
It was just water
It was no problem
It was no trouble
It was our secret
It was very funny
It was very quick
It was very scary
It was very windy
It will grow back
Just do your best
Just tell them no
Keep away from me
Keep out of sight
Keep to the right
Keep your coat on
Knock on the door
Let Tom stay home
Let no one escape
Life is too short
Live and let live
Look at the girls
Look into my eyes
Make up your mind
May God bless you
Maybe I should go
Mom set the table
Move away from me
My bag was stolen
My brother is out
My cat loves toys
My eyes are tired
My father is busy
My father is rich
My father is tall
My glass is dirty
My glass is empty
My hair is greasy
My hands are cold
My hands are tied
My hobby is music
My house is small
My tailor is rich
No one has failed
No one is perfect
No one is talking
No one knows that
No one lives here
No one looks busy
No one misses you
No one was killed
Our train is late
Pay what you want
Pink is for girls
Please fix my toy
Please look at me
Please turn it on
Put out the light
Put some music on
Read it once more
Say it in English
She began to sing
She can handle it
She can jump high
She cooks for him
She decided to go
She did come here
She did it easily
She did it slowly
She drives me mad
She gets up early
She has a bicycle
She has a picture
She has long hair
She has many dogs
She has no figure
She heard him cry
She is a beginner
She is her friend
She is his friend
She knew the teen
She knows my wife
She left the room
She made him rich
She made me hurry
She met her uncle
She must be angry
She must go there
She never told me
She smiled at him
She took her book
Show me that list
Show me the photo
Show me your hand
Stay away from us
Stay here with us
Stay in the house
Stay in this room
Step on the scale
Stop the car here
Take a wild guess
Take care of this
Take his car keys
Take off your cap
Take off your hat
Take one of these
Tell me about him
Tell me the story
Tell me the truth
Thank you so much
That apple is big
That boy is smart
That girl is Mary
That hit the spot
That house is big
That is a mistake
That is her house
That is his house
That is my school
That is your book
That might be fun
That should do it
That wall is cold
That was our plan
The answer is yes
The bar is closed
The bath is ready
The book is small
The book is white
The cage is empty
The cat scared me
The cats are safe
The cops are gone
The cops want you
The dog is theirs
The dog was dying
The dog went away
The enemy is weak
The fight is over
The fire went out
The gun is jammed
The home team won
The horse is mine
The house is warm
The lemon is sour
The lid is closed
The light went on
The lights are on
The man ate bread
The market is big
The meat is tough
The money is gone
The night is dark
The pain has gone
The party is over
The pay is meager
The room was dark
The rumor is true
The sand was warm
The shop was busy
The soup is thick
The street is wet
The sun is rising
The switch is off
The tank is empty
The team needs me
The water is cold
The water is good
The water is pure
The water is warm
The water was hot
The worst is over
There are no gods
There are so many
There is a strike
There is no doubt
There is no hurry
There is no paint
There is one less
They are all dead
They are in class
They are very big
They did it again
They just beat us
They must be cops
They must be fake
They sang in tune
This apple is bad
This bed is heavy
This bird can fly
This book was new
This box is light
This coat is warm
This desk is good
This dog is white
This dog is yours
This egg is fresh
This guy is great
This is a miracle
This is a mistake
This is a picture
This is good meat
This is good news
This is her house
This is his fault
This is his house
This is messed up
This is my choice
This is my family
This is my friend
This is my mother
This is my office
This is my pencil
This is my school
This is my sister
This is not funny
This is our house
This is so boring
This is so stupid
This is so unfair
This is true love
This is very easy
This is very good
This is very true
This is your book
This is your fate
This is your wine
This lake is deep
This plane is his
This wall is cold
This will be easy
Throw me the ball
Today is my treat
Tom broke his arm
Tom called me fat
Tom came too late
Tom can do better
Tom caught a fish
Tom could do that
Tom does love you
Tom expects a lot
Tom fed the horse
Tom has blue eyes
Tom has dark skin
Tom is a preacher
Tom is a teenager

Tom took the bait
Tom travels a lot
Tom waited for me
Tom wanted to cry
Tom wants to come
Tom wants to help
Tom wants to play
Tom went that way
Tom will find you
Tom works at home
Tom would say yes
Try it once again
Try to stay awake
Turn on your back
Turn the hose off
Turn to the right
Wait a bit longer
Water is a liquid
We agree with you
We all got scared
We all have flaws
We are not amused
We chose this one
We finally did it
We gave them food
We had no secrets
We had no trouble
We have a problem
We have good news
We have no chance
We have no choice
We have to escape
We know this song
We live in Boston
We long for peace
We look after him
We looked for her
We love our parks
We made a bargain
We must keep calm
We need a victory
We need an answer
We need fresh air
We need more data
We need more time
We need your help
We play on Sunday
We rented a canoe
We saw them leave
We should ask Tom
We should go home
We tried our best
We tried them all
We want a rematch
We want more food
We want our money
We went due north
We went to Russia
We were all happy
We were all tired
We were all wrong
We were in Boston
We won the battle
You are a student
You are a teacher
You are my father
You are my friend
You are so stupid
You are very nice
You are very rich
You broke my nose
You came too late
You can come home
You can have both
You can trust him

You need to sleep
You read too much
You run very fast
You saved my life
You should go now
You should try it
You talk too much
You two may leave
You work too hard
You work too much
Your book is here
Your face is pale
Your time is over
A cat scratched me
A child is missing
A child needs love
A guard is outside
A storm is brewing
All my plants died
Anyone can do that
Ask her for advice
Ask him for advice
Better him than me
Bring me the flute
Call me right back
Call off your dogs
Clean up that mess
Come along with me
Come along with us
Come into the room
Come near the fire
Count up to thirty
Crime does not pay
Do not disturb her
Drink up your milk
Dust off the shelf
Excuse me a minute
Explain that to me
Fill in the blanks
Fill out this form
Get away from here
Get me some coffee
Get me the details
Give me an example
Give me your money
Give me your phone
Give me your shirt
Give me your watch
Go play in traffic
Go to the hospital
Go up these stairs
Hand me that phone
Hand me the remote
Hand me the wrench
Have a nice flight
Have fun with that

He was not pleased
He went by bicycle
He went on singing

He works very hard
Help me print this

Her skin is smooth
Her socks are gray
Here are our books
Here are the rules
Here are your keys
Here comes the bus
Here is an example
Here is my baggage
Here is my bicycle
Here is some water
His hair was brown
His joke was great
His knees gave way
His name eludes me
His room is untidy
His socks are gray
His wife is French
I accept the offer
I admit my mistake
I almost forgot it
I already did that
I already said yes
I already told you
I am boiling water
I am done teaching
I am from Portugal
I am from Shizuoka
I am grilling fish
I answered for him
I arrived too late
I believe all that
I brought you this
I burned the paper
I can be impartial
I can confirm this
I can explain this
I can hear nothing
I can speak French
I checked the date
I come from Brazil
I confessed my sin
I coughed up blood
I could do nothing
I could not refuse
I ended up winning
I expect your help
I failed the tests
I feared the worst
I feel funny today
I feel like crying
I feel so helpless
I feel very chilly
I feel very guilty
I felt like crying
I felt very sleepy
I felt very uneasy
I forgot my jacket
I forgot my pencil
I found a solution
I fractured my arm

I heard Tom scream
I heard every word
I hid it somewhere
I just emailed you
I just got engaged
I just got married
I know Tom cheated
I know her address
I know his address
I know nothing yet
I know the feeling
I know those women
I know your father
I know your mother
I laughed out loud
I led that mission
I left it unlocked
I like Irish music

I made them myself
I made you cookies
I may die tomorrow
I may not graduate
I miss you already
I moved last month
I must be dreaming
I must destroy you
I need a volunteer
I need an envelope
I need another one
I need hand lotion
I need some advice
I need some nutmeg
I need someone now
I need your advice
I needed the money
I never blamed you
I never doubted it

I never got caught
I never touch beer
I never touched it
I obeyed the rules
I often read books
I oiled my bicycle
I only drink water
I panicked and ran
I play video games

I read your report
I really hate this
I really like snow
I really like that
I really love cats
I really need this
I really needed it
I really should go
I refuse to answer
I refused at first
I remember it well
I repeated my name
I saw the pictures
I saw them kissing
I should take this
I should thank you
I shower every day
I signed the check
I slapped his face
I slept nine hours
I spilled my drink
I still enjoy that
I stopped to smoke
I suggest we hurry
I think that helps
I thought you knew
I thought you quit
I twisted my ankle
I walked to school
I want a boyfriend
I want a challenge
I want an attorney
I want many things
I wanted red shoes
I wanted to change
I was almost right
I was busy cooking
I was just curious

I was only teasing
I was raised right
I was really upset
I was scared stiff
I was sound asleep
I was very careful
I was working late
I was younger then
I went to Nagasaki
I will lose weight
I will protect you
It all makes sense
It came to nothing
It feels like rain
It has no parallel
It is Monday today
It is almost three
It is already dark
It is cloudy today
It is really cheap
It looks like rain
It looks like snow
It looks very nice
It makes sense now
It might be enough
It rained for days
It snowed in Osaka
It started to rain
It started to snow
It was a nightmare
It was all planned
It was good enough
It was no accident
It was quite funny
It was really cold
It was your choice
Keep a low profile
Keep off the grass
Keep the door open
Keep your hands up
Keep your head low
Leave me alone now
Lesson Two is easy
Let her replace it
Let me borrow that
Let me handle this
Let me rephrase it
Life is very short
Look at it closely
Look at that house
Look in the mirror
Love is not enough
Luck is against me
Maybe he likes you
My arm still hurts
My brother is rich
My coach helped me
My dog is pregnant
My dream came true
My dress is ruined
My eyes feel itchy
My family is small
My father is quiet
My father was busy
My garden is small
My husband is lazy
My mother is crazy
My mother loves me
My nose is running
My parents are old
My watch is broken
My wife hates cats
My wife is Chinese
My wife is cooking
No one believed me
No one believes me
No one followed me
No one is immortal
No one is innocent
No one is speaking
No one is thrilled
No one looks happy
No one respects me
No one was injured
No one was present
Nobody can beat me
Nobody can help me
Nobody can stop it
Once is not enough
Our house is yours
Owls have big eyes
Please call him up
Please have a seat
Please let us know
Please look for it
Please make my bed
Please sing a song
Please take a bath
Please take a seat
Push the door open
Real men drink tea
School is over now
Send me a postcard
She always says no
She ate her dinner

She made him happy
She needs our help
She pointed at him
She runs a charity
She shook her head
She wants to dance
She was all smiles
She was born lucky
She was making tea
Show me an example
Show me your hands
Shut off the water
Slip on your shoes
Someone will do it
Stay where you are
Stop being so nice
Stop making a fuss
Stop staring at me
Stop where you are
Stop yelling at me
Strive to be happy
Take a closer look
Take a deep breath
Take off your coat
Take out the trash
Take what you need
Take what you want
Taxes are too high
That book is small
That guy annoys me
That is my opinion
That is our school
That made me laugh
That was a problem
That was my intent
That was very easy
That was very good
That was years ago
That would be fine
The alarm went off
The answer was yes
The apples are red
The area was quiet
The baby is crying
The baby was naked
The bar was packed
The beach is empty
The boy is thirsty
The boy was silent
The car broke down
The case is closed
The chance is gone
The clock says two
The coffee is cold
The damage is done
The danger is over
The dog is panting
The dog looks sick
The door blew open
The door blew shut
The door is closed
The door is locked
The earth is round
The flame went out
The floor gave way
The fog has lifted
The fruit went bad
The fuse has blown
The house is clean
The house is empty
The ice has melted
The ice is melting
The king is coming
The light is green
The light went out
The lights are out
The lock is broken
The meat is frozen
The milk went sour
The moon is bright
The ocean was calm
The paper is white
The parrot is dead
The path is direct
The power went out
The price is right
The road is closed
The skirt is green
The sky cleared up
The snow is melted
The stamp came off
The summer is over
The table is green
The tire leaks air
The tree fell down
The water is clean
The water was blue
The water was cold
The water was warm
The waves are high
The weather is bad
The wind blew hard
The wind died away
The woman is naked
The woman is ready
The world is small
Their answer is no
There are no rules
There goes our bus
There is no choice
There is no escape
There is some wind
There you go again
These are his pens
These are our kids
These dogs are big
These pens are his
They all can drive
They all have come
They all have kids
They almost got us
They are all alike
They are both good
They are not tired
They are too close
They are very kind
They have no money
They live in peace
They live in tents
They made him work
They made the goal
They must be happy
They never gave up
They want you dead
They work at night
They work too much
This apple is sour
This book is small
This cake is sweet
This chair is ugly
This coat fits you
This dog is shaggy
This house is mine
This is a disaster
This is a painting
This is just water
This is my bicycle
This is my brother
This is not enough
This is really low
This is your fault
This is your house
This one is bigger
This room is quiet
This should be fun
This story is true
This was your idea
Those are my books
Those are my pants
Those dogs are big
Today is very cold

Try to remain calm
Tuck your shirt in
Turn off the light
Turn off the radio
Turn on the lights
Turn the volume up
Turn up the volume
Wait just a moment
War affects us all
We adopted a child
We are busy people
We ate some apples
We better be going
We can handle that
We chartered a bus
We drank all night
We drank some wine
We found her alive
We found him alive
We grow wheat here
We had lunch early
We have no comment
We have no secrets
We heard a gunshot
We kept them quiet
We know each other
We listen to music
We lost our chance
We love each other
We missed the exit
We need some money
We sacrifice a lot
We saved your life
We should hang out
We started to walk
We want more money
We watched a movie
We were both drunk
We were just going
We were very close
We were very tired
We will meet again
You are very brave
You are very smart
You broke the rule
You broke your arm
You broke your leg
You can study here
You can trust them
You freaked me out
You guys look lost
You guys wait here
You have a message
You have been busy
You have cute eyes
You have no choice
You just need help
You know the drill
You look just fine
You look very good
You look very pale
You made a promise
You may be correct
You might be right
You might get hurt
You might meet him
You might try that
You must all leave
You must be sleepy
You must be strong
You must find work
You must get going
You only live once
You party too much
You people are mad
You ruined my life
You seem very busy
You should do that
You should know it
You speak too much
You take the money
You taught me that
You taught us that
You were my friend
You were so strong
Your bath is ready
Your face is dirty
A rose smells sweet
Acid acts on metals
Advice is like salt
All sales are final
All share the blame
All swans are white
Anybody can do that
Anybody can read it
Baby ducks are cute
Bad habits die hard
Bring me my glasses
Bring me some water
Bunnies are so cute
Chew your food well
Clear off the table
Come here right now
Cookie needs a walk
Do you own research
Draw a small circle
Every seat was full
Few people think so
Fish is cheap today
Freedom is not free
Get away from there
Get down from there
Get me the evidence
Get your clothes on
Give me two minutes
Go brush your teeth
Good luck with that
Grief drove her mad
Hand in your papers
Have a good weekend
Have a nice holiday
Have a nice weekend
Have a safe journey
He abused our trust
He accepted my idea
He accepted the job
He adopted her idea
He averted his gaze
He became a pianist
He boarded the ship
He bragged about it
He burst into tears
He can hardly speak
He changed his mind
He chased the thief
He comes from Genoa

He cured my illness
He denied that fact
He denied the rumor

Her parents love me
Here is your change
His bicycle is blue
His dream came true
His eyes failed him
His heart is broken
His novel sold well
His parents hate me
His parents love me
His shoes are brown
His sweater is gray
His wife is Swedish
Honesty is a virtue
I accept your offer
I accept your terms
I admire his talent
I almost kissed him
I almost passed out
I already said that
I already sold that
I always study hard
I am an electrician
I am eating noodles
I am peeling apples
I am very dangerous
I answered the door
I became a director
I believe in ghosts
I believe in myself
I bought many books
I called the police
I can come tomorrow
I can smell cookies
I can speak Chinese
I can speak English
I can survive alone
I cleared the table
I come from America
I come from England
I come from Holland
I come from Saitama
I cooked him dinner
I cried all morning
I decorated my room
I did nothing wrong
I did see something
I did some checking
I did some research
I did something bad
I disagree with you
I do not understand
I do that sometimes
I dream every night
I enjoy a challenge

I enjoyed this book
I feel better today
I feel empty inside
I feel like dancing
I feel like singing
I feel like smiling
I feel like waiting
I feel like walking
I feel really proud
I feel very relaxed
I felt very awkward
I find swimming fun
I finished the work
I fix broken radios
I folded the towels
I forgot about that
I forgot my glasses
I forgot my manners
I got really hungry
I had a premonition
I had good teachers
I had little choice
I had some problems
I hate being stupid
I hate long flights
I hate taking risks
I hate these things
I hate this uniform
I have a dictionary
I have another idea
I have bad eyesight
I have chapped lips
I have enough money
I have lucid dreams
I have many talents
I have no insurance
I have no objection
I have no opponents
I have nothing else
I have to apologize
I have two brothers
I have two children
I heard her singing
I heard the message
I heard them coming
I highly doubt that
I hurt myself today
I just cleaned this
I just got promoted
I just stayed quiet
I just want answers
I knew that already
I know her slightly
I know these people
I know your brother
I know your problem
I left school early
I like being single
I like his attitude
I like light colors
I like playing golf
I like taking walks
I like these chairs
I like wild flowers
I like working here
I like your article
I like your cookies
I locked myself out
I love Chinese food
I love French films
I love Italian food
I love this company
I love your sweater
I loved high school
I met him yesterday
I must do something
I must work tonight
I need it yesterday
I need medical help
I need some answers
I need some hangers
I never believed it
I never drink alone
I never go anywhere
I never told anyone
I never trusted Tom
I never wanted that
I never wanted this
I often catch colds
I opened the drawer
I opened the window
I owe you something
I own this property
I pretended to work
I quickly ate lunch
I rang the doorbell
I really admire Tom
I really doubt that
I really enjoyed it
I really like China
I really liked that
I really missed you
I received my bonus
I regret doing that
I remember all that
I remember that guy
I remember the word
I returned to Japan
I reviewed the file
I revised my theory
I rewrote my report
I run every morning
I saw nobody around
I saw you yesterday
I second the motion
I share his opinion
I sleep standing up
I study very little
I suggest you leave
I suppressed a yawn
I talked to friends
I took the medicine
I unlocked the door
I want another beer
I want some answers
I want to apologize
I want to negotiate
I want your opinion
I was drinking milk
I was eighteen then
I was expecting you
I was ill yesterday
I was really scared
I was so humiliated
I watched the movie
I went into details
I will study German
I will wait outside
It can be dangerous
It can be difficult
It could be anybody
It felt pretty good
It happened in Rome
It happened so fast
It is too expensive
It makes me nervous
It may rain tonight
It never snows here
It often rains here
It often snows here
It really bugged me
It serves you right
It snowed all night
It tastes very good
It took all evening
It uses solar power
It was almost funny
It was fairly funny
It was getting dark
It was light enough
It was rather funny
It was really close
It was really funny
It was really weird
It was very painful
It was worth trying
It was your mistake
It works like magic
It would be perfect
I’m able to speak
Just follow my lead
Just leave me alone
Just relax a moment
Keep your eyes open
Keep your gun handy
Leave out this word
Leave the door open
Life has just begun
Life is not perfect
Look at the picture
Look out the window
Look under the seat
Many people do this
Maybe Tom is stupid
Maybe she is coming
Merlin was a wizard
My answer is enough
My aunt looks young
My back still hurts
My brother has died
My camera is broken
My cat loves catnip
My cat loves shrimp
My eyes are burning
My eyes feel gritty
My feet are swollen
My friend helped me
My gums are swollen
My headache is gone
My hobby is cooking
My hobby is reading
My legs are hurting
My life is complete
My mother called me
My mother is active
My nose is bleeding
My phone rang again
My sister is famous
My sister is pretty
My throat feels dry
My trousers are wet
My work is finished
No one ate anything
No one believed him
No one believes him
No one else laughed
No one has anything
No one likes losing
No one really cares
No one really knows
No one saw anything
No one supported me
No one will survive
No one would listen
No weapon was found
Nobody can hear you
Nobody cares for me
Nobody speaks to me
Nothing can stop me
Now eat your supper
Old habits die hard
Only time will tell
Our allies are weak
Our team is winning
Our work never ends
People like to talk
People love to talk
Perhaps I was wrong
Please come on time
Please have a drink
Please make the bed
Please show me that
Please take me home
Please wash my back
Pleased to meet you
Prices are going up
Pull the rope tight
Put on your pajamas
Put some clothes on
Put that in writing
Put your books away
Put your glasses on
Quote me an example
She became a doctor
She became a singer
She became very ill
She boiled the eggs
She bowed in thanks
She called for help
She closed her eyes
She cried all night
She danced with joy
She did pretty well
She does look tired
She drives me crazy
She feels bad today
She has few friends
She has gone abroad
She has lost weight
She has no brothers
She held her breath
She is a chatterbox
She is my classmate
She kept on talking
She kept on working
She kicked the door
She kissed my cheek
She knows the truth
She laced her shoes
She listened to him
She lit the candles
She lives in London
She locked the door
She looks very sick
She made me cookies
She opened the door
She played a sonata
She pulled my shirt
She ran to Shinjuku
She reserved a room
She robbed me blind
She rubbed her eyes
She shaved her head
She speaks too much
She still buys milk
She still loved him
She still loves him
She turned him down
She went on working
She went to Ibaraki
Show me some others
Show me the picture
Show me your tattoo
Shut the door tight
Sign the guest book
Sorry to bother you
Spring will be late
Stand on the scales
Stay out of trouble
Stop being so naive
Stop calling me Tom
Take off your shoes
Take off your socks
Thank you for today
Thank you very much
Thanks for the book
Thanks for the hint
Thanks for the info
Thanks for the meal
Thanks for the ride
That book is theirs
That comes in handy
That day shall come
That depends on you
That explains a lot
That is my overcoat
That looks like fun
That looks like tea
That makes me happy
That makes no sense
That seemed to help
That was months ago
That was my mistake
That was some storm
That would be funny
That would be wrong
The bell is ringing
The bicycle is mine
The blouse is clean
The boat is sinking
The cat is adorable
The chair is broken
The choice is yours
The class went wild
The clock is broken
The coal is burning
The concert is over
The damage was done
The dog followed me
The dog is bleeding
The dog is drooling
The dog is sleeping
The door is closing
The door was closed
The door was locked
The fire alarm rang
The fish smells bad
The food is spoiled
The fridge is empty
The garage is dusty
The ground was cold
The house is vacant
The lake was frozen
The law was changed
The light faded out
The lights went out
The man is starving
The monkey got away
The moon is shining
The news leaked out
The path was narrow
The people fear war
The plan has failed
The pond froze over
The prices are high
The radio is broken
The reason is clear
The room was locked
The room was packed
The server was down
The sirens went off
The sky turned dark
The snow has melted
The snow is melting
The stakes are high
The street is empty
The traffic was bad
The trees are green
The view is amazing
The water is rising
The website is down
The wind has abated
The wind is howling
The window was open
The zipper is stuck
Their answer is yes
There are no knives
There is no problem
There is no urgency
There may be others
There they go again
There was no damage
These are bad times
These are not words
These are our books
These are the rules
These books are new
These cars are ours
They are my friends
They are our guests
They believe in God
They came last week
They did not listen
They died in battle
They have a problem
They have been busy
They have few books
They have no choice
They know our plans
They know the truth
They know your name
They live next door
They lost their dog
They love that song
They love this song
They need the money
They ruined my life
They sang in chorus
They should be fine
They were all there
This coffee is cold
This costs too much
This desk is broken
This dog minds well
This door is locked
This drives me nuts
This forum is great
This is a newspaper
This is all rubbish
This is her handbag
This is just stupid
This is my daughter
This is my notebook
This is my painting
This is my question
This is my umbrella
This is no accident
This is not natural
This is very useful
This lady is Indian
This makes no sense
This never gets old
This novel bores me
This screw is loose
This sheet is light
This table is clean
This table is heavy
This tooth is loose
This winter is warm
Those were the days
Three weeks went by
Time is running out
Tom arrived on foot
Tom bolted the door
Tom borrowed my car
Tom came by himself
Tom can handle this
Tom closed his eyes
Tom could stop this
Tom drinks a little
Tom drinks too much
Tom drives too fast
Tom felt very tired

Try on this sweater
Turn down the music
Turn off the lights
Turn the radio down
Turn your papers in
War concerns us all
We all have arrived
We all have changed
We all have secrets
We all like cycling
We all want answers
We all want changes
We are good friends
We are his children
We are very similar
We both are friends
We both fell asleep
We caught the thief
We did it ourselves
We got your message
We grew up together
We had little water
We have enough data
We have enough time
We love our country
We make great money
We missed our train
We must be cautious
We must inform them
We must leave early
We must not retreat
We need a volunteer
We obeyed the rules
We often play chess
We regret his death
We season with salt
We should do better
We should get going
We want your advice
We wanted to listen
We were all shocked
We were all worried
We were both hungry
We were eating eggs
We were left behind
We will defeat them
Welcome to our home
Welcome to the club
Yesterday I was ill
You are my daughter
You ate my sandwich
You could stop this
You deserve a medal
You guys looked mad
You have dirty feet
You have many books
You have some books
You have three cars
You just screwed up
You look pale today
You look very tired
You lost an earring
You may go anywhere
You must study more
You need a joystick
You never asked why
You passed the test
You really annoy me
You really are nuts
You reek of alcohol
You should eat more
You should meet him
You should thank me
You sure are pretty
You were both drunk
Your French is good
Your father is tall
Your feet are dirty
Your guess is wrong
Your hair is pretty
Your memory is good
Your order is ready
Your shoes are here
Your zipper is open
Yours is over there
A piano is expensive
Acid eats into metal
All men are brothers
All that has changed
All things must pass
All this has changed
Another man has died
Any child knows that
Anyone could do that
Apples grow on trees
Baby teeth are sharp
Be proud of yourself
Both dogs are asleep
Boys are not welcome
Bring all your money
Bring me the Kleenex
Buy the full version
Call me this evening
Cats have nine lives
Cattle feed on grass
Clean up the kitchen
Clothes make the man
Come outside with me
Do whatever it takes
Do whatever you like
Do whatever you want
Do your homework now
Draw a straight line
Dublin is in Ireland
Everyone is doing it
Everyone is gone now
Everyone is here now
Fold up your bedding
Give me your address
Go kiss someone else
Have a great weekend
Have a nice vacation
He achieved his goal
He always plays well
He always works hard
He arrived too early
He attained his goal
He became a Catholic
He breathed his last
He caught three fish
He clipped the sheep
He comes from Geneva
He crossed the river
He deals in hardware
He devoured his meal
He did nothing wrong
He easily gets angry
He emptied his glass
He filed a complaint
He fired three shots
He got bored quickly
He got his doctorate
He had fifty dollars
He has already begun
He has good eyesight
He has no conscience
He has poor eyesight
He has powerful arms
He has rough manners
He insulted our team
He is always reading

He is sadly mistaken
He is still standing
He is very depressed
He is wearing gloves
He is willing enough
He knows many people
He leaned towards me
He likes watching TV
He lives in Nagasaki
He looked very happy
He looked very tired
He looks very sleepy
He lost his eyesight
He managed to escape
He married my cousin
He married my sister
He missed his flight
He misses his father
He needs an umbrella
He never looked back
He never told anyone
He often plays piano
He ordered us steaks
He owns a dishwasher
He raised a question
He ran outside naked
He rarely went there
He removed his shirt
He returned to Japan
He screamed for help
He seems quite happy
He seems very sleepy
He seldom gets angry
He seldom went there
He spoke about peace
He studied very hard
He studies very hard
He suddenly fell ill
He survived his wife
He talked to himself
He tore his ligament
He trained very hard
He turned the corner
He wanted to succeed
He wants red glasses
He was elected mayor
He was fully clothed
He was not impressed
He was sitting there
He went duck hunting
He would not approve
Her daughter is sick
Her name was unknown
Here are the tickets
Here comes the train
His blood is boiling
His book inspired me
His daughter is sick
His face turned pale
His feet were asleep
His hands feel rough
His memory amazes me
His nose is bleeding
His parents loved me
His teeth were white
How high is Mt
Human life is sacred
I abandoned my plans
I admire her efforts
I admire your talent
I almost believe you
I already called him
I also like painting
I always believe you
I always feel hungry
I always feel sleepy
I am drinking coffee
I am getting dressed
I am terribly hungry
I am weighing myself
I apologize for that
I apologize for this
I baked some cookies
I believe that story
I bought an umbrella
I broke your ashtray
I burst out laughing
I can hardly breathe
I can hear something
I caused an accident
I closed my umbrella
I could barely speak
I crossed the street
I cut myself shaving
I daydreamed all day
I did find something
I did that yesterday
I do appreciate that
I dropped my earring
I enjoy working here
I enjoy your company
I feel like vomiting
I feel really stupid
I feel very betrayed
I followed the rules
I forgot his address
I forgot my password
I found an apartment
I found the building
I had an inspiration
I had no alternative
I hate hospital food
I hate long goodbyes
I hate silent movies
I have a reservation
I have a stomachache
I have an invitation
I have back problems
I have bleeding gums
I have bottled water
I have gained weight
I have good eyesight
I have misjudged you
I have no experience
I have no statistics
I have poor eyesight
I have thirteen cats
I have three cameras
I have three cousins
I have three sisters
I have three tickets
I have two daughters
I heard the question
I hugged her tightly
I keep thirteen cats
I know sign language
I know the gentleman
I know your roommate
I leave this evening
I like Japanese food
I like canned fruits
I like coffee better
I like reading books
I like your attitude
I like your earrings
I like your necklace
I like your painting
I liked your dancing
I liked your friends
I lost my flashlight
I lost my sunglasses
I lost that argument
I love American food
I love French movies
I love beach parties
I love fried bananas
I love reading books
I love your daughter
I made that decision
I major in economics
I mean no disrespect
I memorized the poem
I met Mary yesterday
I nearly blacked out
I need another drink
I need more blankets
I never liked school
I parked around back
I pleaded not guilty
I ran like lightning
I really like garlic
I received your note
I rechecked the data
I regret going there
I regret kissing you
I regret saying that
I rejected the offer
I remember this poem
I remember this word
I saw you snickering
I see no alternative
I shower every night
I sincerely hope not
I sometimes watch TV
I sort of understand
I started this topic
I studied last night
I suddenly feel sick
I swallowed my pride
I talked about music
I think I understand
I think I understood
I think you panicked
I touched the bottom
I traveled by myself
I trusted my teacher
I waited three hours
I want some potatoes
I wanted to remember
I was busy yesterday
I was playing tennis
I was pretty relaxed
I was really curious
I was somewhere else
I was very confident
I was very flattered
I was very reluctant
I wish you happiness
It feels really good
It is already eleven
It is hardly raining
It looks really good
It may rain tomorrow
It no longer matters
It really did happen
It seems safe enough
It tastes just right
It was awfully funny
It went off smoothly
Italy is a peninsula
Just close your eyes
Keep the door closed
Keep the door locked
Keep the kids inside
Keep your nose clean
Leave my stuff alone
Let me try something
Lies beget more lies
Life seems so unfair
Look at that picture
Look at this picture
Look before you leap
Love is blinding you
Love knows no limits
Many lives were lost
Many trees fell down
Mary hugged her doll
Maybe I deserve this
Maybe it was obvious
Maybe we should pray
Maybe we should talk
Maybe you were right
Meeting boys is hard
Milk makes us strong
Most people think so
My apartment is near
My brother is stupid
My car needs washing
My eyes are watering
My eyes keep burning
My father grows rice
My father works here
My foot really hurts
My head really aches
My headache has gone
My hobby is shopping
My house burned down
My mother cooks well
My mother was crying
My parents are crazy
My plan was rejected
My sister is married
My son loves rockets
My sons are soldiers
My study is upstairs
My turn finally came
My watch is accurate
No man escapes death
No one escaped alive
No one is downstairs
No one is expendable
No one is unbeatable
No one said anything
Nobody owns the moon
Nobody saw it coming
Nobody spoke with me
Nobody wants to work
Nobody will help you
Not much has changed
Nothing I did helped
Nothing can stop him
Open your mouth wide
Our dog seldom bites
Our dreams came true
Our marriage is over
Perhaps he will come
Play that song again
Playing cards is fun
Please air the futon
Please come this way
Please deal the card
Please do it quickly
Please eat some cake
Please insert a coin
Please keep in touch
Please lock the safe
Please open the door
Please open your bag
Please pull the rope
Please read after me
Please save my place
Please think it over
Please wait a moment
Please write it down
Press the bell twice
Put away your wallet
Put down your pencil
Put the scalpel down
Quit wasting my time
Raise your left hand
Roll down the window
See you all tomorrow
Shake hands with him
She always buys milk
She bought a chicken
She broke into tears
She burst into tears
She can hardly speak
She can speak French
She did it carefully
She drives very fast
She failed to appear
She felt like crying
She grabbed a shower
She has ten children
She ironed her shirt
She is living abroad
She is making dinner
She is my girlfriend
She is skipping rope
She likes these cats
She likes word games
She lives in comfort
She looks very happy
She looks very young
She married a sailor
She mended her socks
She moved my clothes
She often comes late
She plays the guitar
She raised her hands
She raised her voice
She sang pretty well
She served me coffee
She slapped his face
She wanted to travel
She was very excited
She went on speaking
She’s a doctor now
Show me some respect
Show us the solution
Size does not matter
Smog hung over Tokyo
Snow covered the bus
So much is happening
Some people are evil
Someone cut the rope
Someone might see us
Someone stole my bag
Someone told me that
Sorry about the mess
Sorry for being late
Spare me the details
Stay a little longer
Take the garbage out
Take this table away
Thank you for coming
Thank you in advance
Thanks for having me
Thanks for saving me
Thanks for the drink
Thanks for your help
That could take days
That feels very nice
That hat becomes you
That house is famous
That meat is chicken
That narrows it down
That stuff is poison
That was no accident
That was really nice
That will not change
That woman is strong
That would be unfair
The baby fell asleep
The baby is crawling
The baby is sleeping
The basket was empty
The bathtub is dirty
The boy came running
The boy stayed quiet
The boys are excited
The boys are thirsty
The boys worked hard
The bridge is closed
The clock is ticking
The clock struck ten
The curse was broken
The dog is beautiful
The dog looks hungry
The food is terrible
The ground seems wet
The heater is broken
The horse is thirsty
The house is haunted
The house was ablaze
The house went cheap
The light bulb burst
The mail has arrived
The men followed him
The milk turned sour
The monkey came down
The old system works
The pie is delicious
The place was packed
The plates are dirty
The pleasure is mine
The problem is worse
The proof is trivial
The reason is simple
The roads were empty
The rumors were true
The school is closed
The shotgun went off
The shower is broken
The soul is immortal
The speaker is young
The stakes were high
The students like it
The taxi has arrived
The tiger was killed
The towels are dirty
The water pipe burst
The wind calmed down
The wind was howling
The windows are open
Their feet are dirty
There are books here
There are many rooms
There is another way
There is no antidote
There is no solution
There was no warning
There were no knives
There were two cakes
These apples are big
These books are mine
These books are ours
These logs are heavy
These plums are ripe
These shoes are hers
They all have drinks
They are good people
They are not sisters
They are running now
They began this year
They formed a circle
They grow fruit here
They had an argument
They handled it well
They have black hair
They left without me
They love their kids
They opened the door
They robbed me blind
They should have one
They should thank me
They stopped to talk
They tried to escape
They want more space
They were all scared
They were both drunk
They were not amused
Think of your family
Think of your future
This bed looks solid
This bicycle is mine
This book is smaller
This breaks my heart
This button is loose
This camera is cheap
This chair is broken
This diamond is fake
This feels like silk
This fish smells bad
This handbag is mine
This house is creepy
This house is famous
This is Chinese food
This is mind blowing
This laptop is light
This meat is chicken
This meat smells bad
This milk tastes odd
This must be changed
This needs to change
This novel is boring
This one is prettier
This place is creepy
This sweater is warm
This tastes like tea
This tea smells good
This tea smells nice
This video is boring
This wall feels cold
Those apples are big
Those books are mine
Those houses are big
Today is my birthday

Tom writes very well
Tom wrote the report
Tonight is the night
Try to act naturally
Turn down the volume
Turn on the ignition
Wait a little longer
Wash your hands well
We all make mistakes
We all speak English
We are boiling water
We baked it together
We did nothing wrong
We elected her mayor
We elected him mayor
We expect rain today
We have an agreement
We have been friends
We have enough money

We have two children
We hugged each other
We kissed each other
We know our problems
We met last Thursday
We miss Tom terribly
We must abandon ship
We must do something
We need your support
We really are hungry
We want to negotiate
We were going steady
We were just playing
We were very careful
We were very excited
We were younger then
Wipe your face clean
Write down each word
Write your full name
You are a workaholic
You are new students
You are not Japanese
You are under arrest
You are welcome here
You crossed the line
You forgot your coat
You have been warned
You have betrayed us
You have no evidence
You have no messages
You have our respect
You hurt my feelings
You killed my father
You killed my mother
You look happy today
You look really good
You look so handsome
You made it possible
You might be correct
You must be cautious
You must be starving
You owe me something
You said it yourself
You seem happy today
You should not sleep
You should stop that
You should thank him
You should work hard
You talk really fast
You touched my heart
You were great today
You will regret this
Your answer is right
Your answer is wrong
Your mother loves me
Your nose is running
Your pulse is normal
Afghanistan is at war
All lawyers are liars
Always arrive on time
Anybody could do this
Anything will be fine
Autumn is almost here
Bad news travels fast
Be polite to everyone
Bears can climb trees
Believe what you want
Birds have sharp eyes
Both men were rescued
Children need to play
Close all the windows
Close your eyes again
Come downtown with us
Come home before dark
Cotton sucks up water
Dogs often bury bones
Drinking was his ruin
Eat whatever you like
Everyone was doing it
Fasten your seat belt
Food will be included
Fortune smiled on him
Get me another lawyer
Go through the market
Go with your instinct
God created the world
God made the universe
Have a good Christmas
Have a little dignity
Have something to eat
Have yourself a drink
He abandoned all hope
He accepted our offer
He admitted his guilt
He adopted the orphan
He also speaks French
He avenged his father
He became a policeman
He came several times
He can leave tomorrow
He certainly is smart
He cleared his throat
He comes from England
He continued doing it
He could speak French
He crossed the street
He deals in furniture
He defeated his enemy
He delivered a speech
He deserves the prize
He died from overwork
He finally made money
He has absolute power
He has three children
He himself went there
He ignored her advice
He interpreted for me
He is above suspicion
He is always laughing
He is always prepared
He is always studying
He is wearing glasses
He lacks common sense
He licked his fingers
He likes Italian food
He likes taking walks
He looks very worried
He loves taking trips
He never touched wine
He often plays guitar
He presented his card
He rejected our offer
He scratched his head
He speaks really well
He sprained his ankle

He teaches us history
He told me everything
He unbuckled his belt
He was almost drowned
He was awfully skinny
He was chosen captain
He was nearly drowned
He was painfully thin
He went into teaching
He will come tomorrow
He wrote it hurriedly
Her anger was genuine
Her face turned white
Her talent is amazing
Here comes the waiter
His face turned white
His hobby is painting
His ideas sound crazy
Hold the racket tight
I accept your apology
I admire your bravery
I admire your courage
I agree with everyone
I already feel better
I am harvesting wheat
I am totally confused
I appreciate the help
I believe love exists
I bought it yesterday
I bought nine flowers
I broke my fingernail
I came here yesterday
I caught Tom cheating
I did nothing illegal
I did something wrong
I dislike being alone
I drank tea yesterday
I enjoy salsa dancing
I extended my holiday
I feel better already
I feel perfectly fine
I feel so embarrassed
I feel very confident
I felt bad afterwards

I find that offensive
I find you attractive
I find you intriguing
I followed the recipe
I forgave his mistake

I get motion sickness
I had second thoughts
I hate this apartment
I hated history class
I have an appointment
I have another sister
I have kidney trouble
I have life insurance
I have no explanation
I have serious doubts
I have terrible pains
I have the dictionary
I have three children
I hear someone coming
I heard what happened
I hired someone today
I hope you understand
I just started crying
I knew Tom personally
I knew everyone there
I know everybody here
I know these students
I like English better
I like French cooking
I like Japanese girls
I like dark chocolate
I like their pictures
I like your frankness
I lost my inspiration
I love playing Chopin
I love romance novels
I love your apartment
I meant no disrespect
I misspelled the word
I must learn Japanese
I need an interpreter
I need it immediately
I need something else
I needed it yesterday
I often feel homesick
I often make mistakes
I postponed the event
I prefer this version
I really enjoyed that
I really like puppies
I really like seafood
I recognized his face
I recognized the name
I recommend it highly
I remember it vividly
I remember seeing her
I remember seeing him
I remember the letter
I remember this music
I remember those days
I require your advice
I respect the elderly
I respect your talent
I share your feelings
I shave every morning
I should do something
I still make mistakes
I suggest we continue
I talked to everybody
I told him everything
I totally believe you
I totally freaked out
I used my imagination
I want an explanation
I want another chance
I want something more
I want to participate
I wanted your opinion
I was falsely accused
I was happy yesterday
I was quite surprised
I was so disappointed
I worked this morning
It can be frustrating
It could be dangerous
It could rain tonight
It frosted last night
It happened very fast
It has been confirmed
It has been wonderful
It might prove useful
It might snow tonight
It seems quiet enough
It seems warm outside
It serves our purpose
It smells like bleach
It tastes really good
It was Saturday night
It was cold yesterday
It was extremely cold
It was not conclusive
It was not unexpected
It was pretty obvious
It was quite pleasant
It was very beautiful
It was very difficult
It will probably rain
Jupiter is very large
Just turn this handle
Keep next Sunday free
Keep your hands clean
Keep your hands still
Kids do stupid things
Lawyers are all liars
Leave my camera alone
Leave my family alone
Leave my things alone
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let the children play
Listen to your mother
Look at that building
Look at that mountain
Make yourself at home
Many people are upset
Marriage is a lottery
Mary has her problems
May comes after April
Maybe we should start
Meeting girls is hard
Money opens all doors
Money rules the world
My baggage is missing
My bicycle was stolen
My brother is healthy
My cat died yesterday
My class was canceled
My father loves pizza
My instinct was right
My mother makes cakes
My mother was furious
My parents are asleep
My phone is vibrating
My sister got engaged
My sister often cries
My suitcase is broken
My uncle plays guitar
Nail the windows shut
No one encouraged her
No one heard anything
No one knows anything
No tickets are needed
Nobody can control us
Nobody cares about me
Nobody does it better
Nobody knows his name
Nobody likes that guy
Nobody listened to me
None of your business
Not all experts agree
Nothing is ever right
Nuclear power is safe
Obviously he is wrong
Only one man survived
Our water pipes burst
People laughed at him
Playing tennis is fun
Please close the door
Please copy this page
Please heat the water
Please leave me alone
Please let me explain
Please light a candle
Please take my advice
Please think about it
Please throw the ball
Prices have gone down
Proper ID is required
Roll down your window
Say you understand me
School begins at nine
Sewing is manual work
She accepted his gift
She achieved her goal
She almost passed out
She altered her plans
She answered in tears
She caught her breath
She committed a crime

She got brushed aside
She has abundant hair
She has gone shopping
She has two daughters
She helped cook lunch
She ironed his shirts
She is always smoking
She is gaining weight
She is very beautiful
She left her children
She likes Russian pop

She looks very afraid
She misses her father
She never wears green
She played the violin
She refused his offer
She returned his kiss
She returned to Japan
She screamed for help
She taught us singing
She teaches us French
She was fully clothed
She watched him dance
She weeded the garden
She wept with emotion
She wriggled her toes
Show me another watch
Show me your passport
Sit wherever you like
Somebody stole my car
Someone asked for you
Someone took my place
Something is odd here
Speak a little louder
Spring is coming soon
Stick out your tongue
Still waters run deep
Stop being so curious
Stop flirting with me
Summer has just begun
Summer is almost over
Take care of yourself
Take off your clothes
Tears filled her eyes
Tell me what happened
Tests start next week
Thank you for calling
Thank you for waiting
Thanks for joining us
Thanks for the advice
That could be helpful
That game was awesome
That house is haunted
That is my dictionary
That is very exciting
That kiss was amazing
That makes more sense
That man is dangerous
That might be serious
That really scares me
That should be enough
That was great advice
That water pipe leaks
The airport is closed
The beach was crowded
The birds are singing
The bookstore is open
The boy was shirtless
The boys were injured
The cake is delicious

The door was unlocked
The doors were closed
The feeling is mutual
The files are missing
The food is delicious

The goldfish is alive
The hotel burned down
The house caught fire
The kettle is boiling
The meat is expensive
The meeting went well
The mistakes are mine
The mountain is green

The pizza tasted good
The problem is solved
The rain is wonderful
The rumors were false
The same applies here
The soldiers are dead
The streets are clean
The thief ran quickly
The town is beautiful
The town was deserted
The train has arrived
The tubes are clogged
The two brothers died
The vote is unanimous
The water is lukewarm
The weather was ideal
The women are working
The world has changed
The young girl sighed
Their car passed ours
Their son grew bigger
There are no problems
There is nothing here
There was another one
There was no bathroom
There was no response
These books are heavy
These boxes are heavy
They all looked happy
They are out shopping
They arrived too soon
They found each other
They found him guilty
They hated each other
They loaded the truck
They missed the train
They must be replaced
They never drink beer
They saw us yesterday
They shared the money
They shouted for help
They talked all night
They used truth serum
They wash their hands
They were all friends
They were all smiling
They were not pleased
They will never agree
They worked like bees
Think of your brother
Think outside the box
This banana is rotten
This blouse is cotton
This car handles well
This chair is plastic
This could be serious
This data is outdated
This food is terrible
This heater burns gas
This house is haunted

This is very exciting
This makes me curious
This news is official
This party is awesome
This pear smells nice
This road is terrible
This should be plenty
This string is strong
This stuff is amazing

Those are empty words
Those are my trousers
Those photos are hers

Time heals all wounds

We got along famously
We have a reservation
We have no complaints

Weigh your words well
Whatever he says goes
Winter is coming soon
Wisdom comes with age
You are her daughters
You are seriously ill
You can start anytime
You deserve a present
You deserve the prize
You did nothing wrong
You have many friends
You have to disappear
You heard your mother
You look so beautiful
You must be exhausted
You need an ambulance
You should be careful
You should smoke less
Your boots are ruined
Your cat will survive
Your cough worries me
Your friends are late
Your nose is bleeding
Your parents are cool
Your shoes are untied
Zero comes before one
A magnet attracts iron
A password is required
A sponge absorbs water
All seats are reserved
Badgers dig deep holes
Better late than never
Better safe than sorry
Bring me the newspaper
Business is looking up
Business is quite slow
Cats have pointed ears
Cats usually hate dogs
Charity begins at home
Choose between the two
Come whenever you like
Come whenever you want
Defend her from danger
Dinner is almost ready
Dogs are loyal animals
Dry wood burns quickly
Elves have pointy ears
Even Tom was surprised
Everybody calls me Tom
Everybody puts me down
Everyone called me Tom
Everyone can do better
Everyone is against me
Everyone is not honest
Everyone knew the song
Everyone knows the law
Everyone will be happy
Everything has a price
Fasten your seat belts
Figure it out yourself
Flowers make her happy
Forget I said anything
Give me another chance
Give me the microphone
Give me thirty seconds
Hand over your weapons

Just follow your heart
Keep the meter running
Keep the window closed
Let bygones be bygones
Listen to me carefully
Look at the blackboard

Nothing seemed to work
Opinions are not facts

He can drive a car
He can swim a mile
He died in his bed
He found me a taxi
He gave her a book
He gave him a book
He gave me a watch
He got ahead of me
He got off the bus
He had fun with it
He had to go there
He has a big mouth
He has a big truck
He has a long nose
He has his own car
He is a bad driver
He is a bad person
He is a bank clerk
He is a clever boy
He is a good loser
He is a slim child
He is about my age
He is about to die
He is all but dead
He is on the radio
He is only a child
He is still in bed
He is sure to come
He is well off now
He kept his hat on
He lay on his back
He lied to my face
He owes me a favor
He sat next to her
He seems to be ill
He showed it to me
He took a big risk
He wants a new car
He was a good king
He went out to eat
Help is on its way
Help me if you can
His play was a hit
I am a new student
I am an only child
I am doing my best
I am fond of music
I am in deep water
I am in the garden
I am just a nobody
I am not a teacher
I am not ready yet
I am not too tired
I am sorry for you
I asked who he was
I baked it for you
I beat him at golf
I bought a new bag
I bought a new car
I bought a red tie
I bought him a tie
I came to kill him
I can do it myself
I can go next week
I can help you out
I can ride a horse
I can see that now
I can wait for you
I could be of help
I did all the work
I did it like this
I did this for you
I did what I could
I did write to him
I doubt if it will
I eat in the house
I envy you so much
I feel bad for her
I feel like a fool
I feel like a rest
I fell in the pool
I gave you my word
I give you my word
I had a good coach
I had a good sleep
I had a great time
I had a late lunch
I had an awful day
I had him write it
I had loads of fun
I had things to do
I had to accept it
I had to lie again
I had to walk home
I handed him a map
I hate all of them
I have a black eye
I have a dry cough
I have a fish tank
I have a glass eye
I have a pain here
I have lost my key
I have lost my pen
I have my own room
I have to dress up
I have to find Tom
I have to find her
I have to know now
I have to know why
I have to meet him
I have to paint it
I have to warn him
I heard him go out
I hope Tom has fun
I hope Tom is safe
I jog twice a week
I just got a raise
I just got an idea
I just want to cry
I just want to die
I kind of like you
I know all of them
I know him by name
I know it by heart
I know what I like
I know what to say
I know who you are
I know you love me
I lay down to rest
I lead a busy life
I left my bag here
I let you catch me
I like all of them
I like it that way
I like to be early
I like to think so
I like to watch TV
I live in the city
I lost my car keys
I love both of you
I made a few calls
I made a pot roast
I made her a dress
I mean you no harm
I met an old woman
I met him just now
I miss her so much
I miss you so much
I must find my key
I need a mouse pad
I need to be alone
I need to go there
I need to know now
I only did my duty
I owe you a dinner
I put my helmet on
I ran to my mother
I run a tight ship
I said he could go
I saw him just now
I saw the man jump
I saw what you did
I saw you with Tom
I should go to bed
I sleep in my room
I sleep on my side
I slept on the bus
I sort of like him
I still want to go
I think I did well
I think Tom did it
I think Tom is old
I think Tom is sad
I think you did it
I tried not to cry
I use it every day
I want a low table
I want a new dress
I want my job back
I want my key back
I want to be heard
I want to die soon
I want to enjoy it
I want to go there
I want to have fun
I want to hold you
I want to join you
I want to keep one
I want to kiss Tom
I want to know now
I want to know why
I want to see more
I want to see them
I want to see this
I want to sit down
I want to talk now
I want to tell you
I want to warn you
I want you to sing
I want you to stop
I want you to talk
I wanted to say no
I was able to knit
I was at home then
I was at the party
I was busy all day
I was forced to go
I was on the phone
I was the only man
I went to the shop
I will go on ahead
I will wait a week
I wish I were rich
I worked on a farm
It can not be true
It could be a trap
It is a long story
It is too long ago
It was a bad movie
It was all so easy
It was kind of fun
It was only a joke
It was sort of fun
It was worth a try
Just do what I did
Just do what I say
Just say yes or no
Keep an eye on him
Keep out of my way
Let Tom do his job
Let go of the rope
Let me go with you
Let me grab my bag
Let us out of here
Move out of my way
My car is a Toyota
My nose is too big
No one can do that
No one can hear us
No one can help me
No one can help us
No one can stop me
No one is at fault
Pray for all of us
She came to my aid
She came to see me
She did a good job
She gave it to him
She gave me a doll
She is a kind girl
She is a poor cook
She left me a note
She made him do it
She made me a cake
She made me a star
She put on her hat
She sat next to me
She was a bit late
She was in a hurry
Some of us hate it
Stay out of my way
Stop me if you can
Take a sip of this
Take her to the OR
Tell me what to do
That is good to me
That is not my pen
The car hit a tree
The law is the law
The men go to work
The only way is up
They gave it to me
They made me do it
This is a big deal
This is a big help
This is a bus stop
This is a road map
This is all I know
This is all I want
This is how I feel
This is not a game
This is not a trap
This is not for me
This is not my car
This is not so fun
Time is on my side
Tom could be a spy
Tom did a good job
Tom got in the car
Tom has a big nose
Tom has a blue car
Tom has to act now
Tom has to go home
Tom hit a home run
Tom is a bad coach
Tom is a good cook
Tom is a great guy
Tom is a grown man
Tom is in the park
Tom is now in jail
Tom is on the roof
Tom knows who I am
Tom sang me a song
Tom took a day off
Tom was a good guy
Tom was sure of it
Tom won a free car
Try not to be late
We all cried a lot
We do not know her
We had fun with it
We have lots to do
We have more to do
We love what we do
We made sure of it
We ran in the park
We ran out of food
We swam in the sea
We took a mud bath
We want to be fair
We want to hear it
We went for a walk
We went to a movie
You are a good boy
You are free to go
You can rely on me
You get used to it
You had a long day
You have to get up
You know how it is
You may go at once
You may use my car
You need to fix it
You need to let go
You owe me a favor
You were in a coma
A dog has four legs
A nap would be good
A noise woke her up
A truck hit the dog
A whale is a mammal
All I have is books
All I want is money
All is well with me
All of us are happy
All you do is party
Ask Tom to be quiet
Best of luck to you
Call if you need me
Catch me if you can
Do exactly as I say
Get Tom to help you
Get out of my chair
Get out of my house
Get out of my sight
Give it back to her
Give it back to him
Give me back my hat
Give my back my bag
Go and wake Mary up
Go jump in the lake
Have a beer with me
Have a piece of pie
He asked for a beer
He bought a new car
He bought her a dog
He called me a taxi
He came home at ten
He came to my house
He can be relied on
He can help you out
He can play a flute
He caught a big one
He died a sad death
He does not like us
He dropped in on me
He felt ill at ease
He flew into a rage
He gave a deep sigh
He gave me an apple
He gave me his word
He got on the train
He had fun with her
He had his hair cut
He has a funny name
He has a loud voice
He has a nose bleed
He has a round face
He has a square jaw
He has gone too far
He has his own room
He is a born artist
He is a fast runner
He is a good doctor
He is a good singer
He is a good writer
He is a hard worker
He is a jealous man
He is a lazy fellow
He is a learned man
He is a nice person
He is a rude person
He is about my size
He is an honest man
He is apt to forget
He is at his office
He is at home today
He is at the office
He is far from rich
He is good at rugby
He is my old friend
He is ready to work
He is taking a walk
He is tall and lean
He is telling a lie
He is washing a car
He is wearing a hat
He laid on his back
He lays on his back
He left a while ago
He left me the keys
He lives in his car
He looks like a bug
He made up his mind
He may have said so
He may not be happy
He ran out of money
He really got to me
He refused to do so
He runs a shoe shop
He said he was poor
He sat on the bench
He seemed to be ill
He seems to be rich
He seems to be sick
He seems to know us
He set off to Paris
He slept in the car
He stuck to his job
He told me about it
He took off his hat
He used to love her
He wants that a lot
He wants to kill me
He was born in Ohio
He was the only man
He was wet all over
He went on doing it
He won a gold medal
He would not go out
Her son is a genius
His dog barks at me
His son is a genius
Hurry up and get in
I also love to cook
I am a fast swimmer
I am afraid of dogs
I am bored to death
I am engaged to her
I am fond of skiing
I am free from care
I am going to sleep
I am going to study
I am in charge here
I am like my mother
I am not your enemy
I am off duty today
I am older than him
I am poor at tennis
I am reading a book
I am right for once
I am short of money
I am the chosen one
I ate a light lunch
I beat him at chess
I bet you know this
I bought a VIP pass
I bought you a gift
I broke up with her
I broke up with him
I built a new house
I can barely see it
I can come at three
I can keep a secret
I can peel an apple
I can see the light
I could use a drink
I decided not to go
I did it many times
I did no such thing
I did not know this
I did that ages ago
I did that one time
I do agree with Tom
I do not deserve it
I do not fear death
I do not like music
I do not read books
I do not sleep well
I eat with my hands
I feel a lot better
I feel bad about it
I feel bad for them
I feel kind of sick
I feel like a drink
I feel the same way
I felt out of place
I felt the same way
I finally got a job
I forgot to ask Tom
I forgot to ask him
I gave him the book
I got a weird email
I got that from Tom
I got up about five
I got what I needed
I got you a present
I guess I was lucky
I guess I was wrong
I had a light lunch
I had a little help
I had a weird dream
I hate that so much
I hate to eat alone
I have a chest pain
I have a high fever
I have a pretty dog
I have a runny nose
I have but one wish
I have lost the key
I have lots of time
I have only one pen
I have to find that
I have to leave now
I have to leave you
I have to stay here
I have to warn them
I hear with my ears
I hid behind a tree
I hope he sees this
I hope he will come
I hope to marry her
I just brewed a pot
I just feel so lost
I just got off duty
I just got the news
I just saw the news
I just want to help
I just want to read
I just want to rest
I just want to talk
I kind of messed up
I knew it was right
I knew that was Tom
I know Tom is smart
I know a few things
I know all about it
I know both of them
I know how you feel
I know it very well
I know none of them
I know this is hard
I know this is true
I know what that is
I know what this is
I know what you did
I know where she is
I know where we are
I know you are rich
I know you did that
I know you did this
I know you feel bad
I know you feel sad
I know you love Tom
I know you miss Tom
I leave that to you
I let the team down
I like Boston a lot
I like each of them
I like it very much
I like to play golf
I like what you did
I like where I live
I live in Kyoto now
I live in the house
I love to eat cakes
I love to play golf
I love you the most
I made a phone call
I made sure of that
I make my own rules
I managed to get in
I may not have time
I meant what I said
I meant you no harm
I met her by chance
I met him by chance
I must be going now
I must get it fixed
I must have lost it
I must look a sight
I need a heavy coat
I need lots of time
I need the car keys
I need to repay her
I need to sleep now
I never lied to you
I never make my bed
I often call on him
I only saw him once
I only think of you
I quit after a week
I ran like the wind
I ran out of breath
I really have to go
I really need a hug
I really need to go
I saw her last week
I see her every day
I see what you mean
I see you are ready
I sent you an email
I sprang out of bed
I stared at the man
I still have to try
I stole it from Tom
I think Tom is dead
I think Tom is hurt
I think Tom is sick
I think he is angry
I think he is right
I think he likes me
I think she is sick
I think they saw me
I think they saw us
I think we found it
I think we lost Tom
I think you like me
I told you to leave
I took care of that
I took my shoes off
I tried to help her
I tried to help him
I tried to run fast
I tried to save him
I tried to save you
I tried to tell you
I tried to warn you
I used to love that
I used to play here
I wanna go to Japan
I wanna quit my job
I want him to leave
I want more of that
I want my life back
I want to eat steak
I want to go abroad
I want to hear more
I want to hear this
I want to keep that
I want to learn how
I want to live here
I want to move away
I want to speak now
I want to start now
I want to thank you
I want to trust you
I wanted to see Tom
I wanted you to win
I was all by myself
I was aware of that
I was born in Kyoto
I was born in Osaka
I was going to work
I was happy for him
I was like you once
I went to bed early
I will be back soon
I will hit the sack
I will miss you all
I will not help you
I will try it again
I wish I could swim
I wish I were young
I wish Tom the best
I wish Tom was here
I wish you the same
I wonder who she is
I would do it again
I would like a room
It bothers me a lot
It did not come off
It did not end well
It is a little cold
It is going to snow
It looks like a UFO
It may well be true
It was a busy night
It was a dark night
It was a great trip
It was a nice party
It was a nice story
It was all worth it
It was fine all day
It was hard as rock
It was just a dream
It was just a fling
It was just a hunch
It was like a dream
It was not my fault
It was only a dream
It was the only way
Just give it a shot
Keep me in the loop
Kids can be so mean
Lay it on the table
Let me pay my share
Let me win for once
Life is not all fun
Love is not a crime
Maybe we can fix it
Move out of the way
My dad will kill me
My dog needs a walk
My hair is too long
My home is far away
My mom will kill me
My sister has a job
No more can be said
No one ate the cake
No one came up here
No one can help you
No one could see us
No one will help us
No one will miss me
No one will stop us
None of us like Tom
Now is not the time
Of course I will go
One of you is lying
Rome is an old city
See you in two days
She baked me a cake
She came near to me
She came out on top
She can drive a car
She gave him a book
She gave me a watch
She got in the taxi
She had gone to bed
She has a long nose
She is a bad person
She is about my age
She is fond of cake
She is hard at work
She is hard on them
She is just a child
She is not here yet
She is not to blame
She is still a girl
She likes all of us
She sat next to him
She told him a joke
She wants a new hat
She works in a bank
Sing a song with me
Stay out of my room
Take a look at this
Take my word for it
Tell Tom to shut up
Tell me if it hurts
Tell me where he is
That guy is a crook
That is a good idea
That is not a tiger
That is not my line
The boy bowed to me
The cat is not dead
The cup has a crack
The dog bit my hand
The dog bit the man
The idea is not bad
The idea is not new
The man took my arm
The room is too big
They did a good job
They made fun of me
This guy is a crook
This guy is a loser
This is a good deal
This is all for you
This is an old book
This is kind of fun
This is my city now
This is my old bike
This is not a tiger
This is so much fun
This is what I want
This may hurt a bit
Tom can drive a car
Tom forced me to go
Tom had a rough day
Tom has a bald spot
Tom has a big house
Tom has a big mouth
Tom has a white dog
Tom helped us a lot
Tom is a con artist
Tom is back in town
Tom is good at math
Tom is not a member
Tom is on the phone
Tom kept his hat on
Tom owes us a favor
Tom paid for it all
Tom plays in a band
Tom said it was fun
Tom said to ask you
Tom sat at his desk
Tom took a bad fall
Try to do your best
Try to keep it down
Use this as a model
Wake me up at eight
Wake me up at seven
We are all born mad
We are in a library
We can hide in here
We cut off the rope
We had a huge fight
We had a rough time
We had an oral exam
We have seen no one
We have to warn him
We lay on the grass
We love you so much
We made a good team
We make a good team
We may need it soon
We mean you no harm
We must do it again
We must not be late
We must pay the tax
We need to help Tom
We ran out of money
We swam in the lake
We took a long walk
We want out of here
We want to help Tom
We will do our best
You are a good cook
You asked to see me
You can not miss it
You can rely on him
You can sing a song
You guys are no fun
You have a big nose
You knew I was here
You know who I mean
You know why I left
You look like a boy
You look like a cop
You look like a kid
You may come in now
You may not like it
You may rely on him
You must be in love
You must not say it
You need to do this
You need to grow up
You need to help me
You need to move on
You need to wake up
You owe me big time
You ran a red light
A cat has nine lives
A horse is an animal
A man must be honest
Add more water to it
All my stuff is here
All we need is water
Birds fly in the sky
Boston is a big city
Bring me a dry towel
Call me when you can
Cats hate to get wet
Come back in an hour
Come in for a minute
Do come and visit us
Do come by all means
Do what he tells you
Fish live in the sea
Get back to the ship
Get him off my hands
Get in the back seat
Get out of my office
Get out of the truck
Get out of the water
Get that book for me
Give me the car keys
Give that back to me
Go and open the door
Go back to your room
Go back to your seat
Have it your own way
Have some pity on me
He acted as my guide
He aimed at the bird
He and I are cousins
He asked me for help
He began to feel ill
He begged me to stay
He bent his head low
He built a new house
He came into my room
He came to my rescue
He can be counted on
He caught a big fish
He chose a good wife
He decided not to go
He did it right away
He died one year ago
He died the next day
He fell to the floor
He felt a sharp pain
He gave a short talk
He gave me this book
He gets on my nerves
He got angry with me
He got his dander up
He got off the train
He had lost all hope
He has a common name
He has a dark secret
He has a fair income
He has a foreign car
He has a good accent
He has a good memory
He has a hairy chest
He has a large truck
He has a nimble mind
He has a strong body
He has a strong will
He has a sweet voice
He has nothing to do
He has to study hard
He has very bad luck
He held out his hand
He held up his hands
He hit me by mistake
He is a cruel person
He is a fast speaker
He is a good speaker
He is a good student
He is a good swimmer
He is a handsome man
He is a harsh critic
He is a lazy student
He is a tough cookie
He is about your age
He is afraid of dogs
He is afraid to swim
He is always with me
He is an angry drunk
He is an unsung hero
He is angry with you
He is away from home
He is bad at driving
He is close to sixty
He is far from happy
He is five feet tall
He is full of energy
He is good at soccer
He is hard to please
He is his own master
He is his usual self
He is in his library
He is in poor health
He is in the kitchen
He is in trouble now
He is likely to come
He is my best friend
He is off duty today
He is precious to us
He is quite a savage
He is reading a book
He is the chosen one
He jumped out of bed
He knew it all along
He knows how to swim
He left a minute ago
He likes music a lot
He likes to watch TV
He lived a long life
He lives like a king
He looks like a girl
He made for the door
He made her his wife
He made up an excuse
He made up the story
He may have been ill
He must have seen it
He needs to be alone
He never tells a lie
He never wears a tie
He picked up a stone
He ran at full speed
He ran into the room
He ran up the stairs
He saw a pretty girl
He seems to be happy
He seems to think so
He sent me a present
He swims like a fish
He thinks I love her
He took off his coat
He tried to stand up
He used to live here
He used to love that
He wanted to meet me
He wants to kiss her
He wants to meet you
He was a good friend
He was born in Osaka
He was drunk on beer
He was in the shower
He was out of breath
He was put in prison
He went to bed early
He went to the store
He will be back soon
He will be here soon
He works as a busboy
He wrote me a letter
I agree to this plan
I am a stranger here
I am afraid of bears
I am afraid of death
I am afraid of dying
I am better than you
I am counting on you
I am eating an apple
I am looking at that
I am no longer tired
I am playing it safe
I am poor at drawing
I am telling a story
I am waiting my turn
I am wasting my time
I applied for a visa
I asked him his name
I ate too much today
I awoke from a dream
I awoke on the floor
I bear him no malice
I bought a red diary
I bought an old lamp
I bought her a clock
I bought him a clock
I broke my right leg
I built this for you
I came here to learn
I came here to study
I can live with that
I can make it happen
I can play the piano
I can read your mind
I can ride a bicycle
I can squeeze you in
I can swim very fast
I can take a message
I can wait no longer
I chose not to leave
I could kill you now
I count on your help
I decided not to eat
I did it without you
I did not order this
I did what was right
I did what you asked
I do not feel guilty
I do not like spring
I do not mince words
I eat here every day
I expect him to come
I expect much of him
I feel kind of tired
I feel like an idiot
I feel safe with you
I feel sorry for her
I feel sorry for him
I feel sorry for you
I felt like an idiot
I felt sorry for you
I forget who said it
I got it for nothing
I guess Tom is right
I had a busy morning
I had a good teacher
I had a heart attack
I had a lovely night
I had a speech ready
I had a tooth pulled
I had an early lunch
I had fun last night
I had it all planned
I had never seen her
I had nothing to say
I had only one drink
I had to act quickly
I hate cops like him
I hated you at first
I have a bad sunburn
I have a better idea
I have a big problem
I have a few friends
I have a new bicycle
I have a slight cold
I have a sweet tooth
I have a wooden comb
I have been to India
I have caught a cold
I have lost my watch
I have lots of ideas
I have lots of money
I have lunch at noon
I have my own theory
I have no more ideas
I have read the book
I have so many ideas
I have such bad luck
I have to be careful
I have to wear boots
I heard you did well
I just bought a boat
I just cracked a rib
I just cut my finger
I just need a minute
I just took a shower
I just want you back
I kept my mouth shut
I knew Tom would win
I know Tom very well
I know Tom was angry
I know all about you
I know her very well
I know him very well
I know lots of songs
I know that you know
I know what they are
I know what to study
I know what you know
I know what you mean
I know you know this
I left the door open
I left you a message
I lent Tom my camera
I lied to my parents
I like her dark eyes
I like her very much
I like him very much
I like to eat apples
I like to play poker
I like to read books
I like to sing songs
I like you very much
I live a simple life
I live in this hotel
I look forward to it
I looked at my watch
I looked for the key
I lost my house keys
I lost track of time
I love the food here
I made a big mistake
I made a few changes
I made a lucky guess
I made a model plane
I made a paper plane
I make a good living
I met a friend there
I met him about noon
I met him in January
I met them last week
I miss you very much
I missed you so much
I must be going deaf
I must buy some milk
I must talk with you
I need a clean shirt
I need a drink first
I need a fresh start
I need a little time
I need a new bicycle
I need it right away
I need to study math
I need you right now
I needed to meet you
I never asked for it
I never did it again
I never saw his face
I no longer like you
I no longer love him
I no longer love you
I now agree with Tom
I only need a minute
I only saw the apple
I owe him some money
I prefer it that way
I prefer it this way
I prefer to be alone
I prefer to go alone
I put on my trousers
I ran into my friend
I really love my job
I really ought to go
I refuse to allow it
I refused to be paid
I said it might rain
I should go with you
I showed her my room
I showed him my room
I showed him the way
I swim in the summer
I thank you for that
I think Tom can help
I think Tom did that
I think Tom did this
I think Tom did well
I think Tom has gone
I think Tom is awake
I think Tom is drunk
I think Tom is loyal
I think Tom is ready
I think Tom is right
I think Tom liked it
I think Tom needs me
I think Tom will win
I think he likes you
I think my mom knows
I think that was Tom
I think they know me
I think they know us
I think they like me
I think they like us
I think they saw you
I think this is mine
I think this will do
I think we should go
I think you heard me
I think you look hot
I thought I knew you
I thought I was cool
I thought it was Tom
I took the wrong bus
I tried not to stare
I tried to kiss Mary
I turned off the tap
I turned on the lamp
I used to drink beer
I want a new kitchen
I want my money back
I want some of those
I want the other one
I want them all shot
I want to be careful
I want to be invited
I want to be noticed
I want to go fishing
I want to play cards
I want to please you
I want to see Boston
I want to start over
I want to stay alive
I want to take notes
I want to watch this
I want what you want
I want you back here
I wanted to go there
I wanted to help you
I wanted to share it
I wanted to tell you
I was afraid of that
I was bored to death
I was busy this week
I was home all night
I was hurt and upset
I was in bed already
I was jealous of you
I was looking at her
I was planning on it
I was reading a book
I was the only woman
I went into the army
I went to the market
I will come with you
I will have him come
I will make some tea
I will never see him
I will show you some
I will try next week
I wish I was kidding
I wish I were clever
I wish I were taller
I wish you good luck
I wish you were here
I woke up at sunrise
I wonder who took it
I work in a hospital
I would like to draw
It affects all of us
It belongs to me now
It felt like a dream
It glows in the dark
It has to be removed
It is a payday today
It is in the kitchen
It is kind of pretty
It is of great value
It is out of fashion
It is to be expected
It is very cold here
It is very hot today
It is wrong to steal
It looks good on you
It looks like an egg
It makes me so happy
It pays to be polite
It rained for a week
It sounds good to me
It took half an hour
It was a false alarm
It was a good answer
It was a long letter
It was a quiet night
It was a stupid idea
It was a tedious job
It was an awful week
It was his best time
It was his own fault
It was kind of weird
It was time to leave
It will be dark soon
It would be too easy
Just get out of here
Keep your eye on him
Let go of the bottle
Let go of the handle
Let me call you back
Let me deal with him
Let me get my wallet
Let me see that list
Let me take a gander
Look at that big dog
Look at the dog jump
Look in front of you
Make him work for it
Many men died at sea
Mary did it for free
Mary is a brave girl
Maybe I can show you
Maybe I should do it
Maybe Tom is in love
Meet me in the lobby
Men are all the same
Mom is making a cake
My bag is very heavy
My dad works all day
My father is at home
My home is your home
My house was on fire
My left hand is numb
My life is in danger
My school has a band
My skirt is too long
My son can tell time
No news is good news
No one can deny that
No one else knows it
No one has been here
No one is asking you
No one seems to care
None of this is good
None of us want that
Please do not buy it
Put it on my account
Put your hat back on
Send the kids to bed
She acted as a guide
She arrived in a car
She bought a new car
She bought a tea set
She bought him a car
She fell on her face
She felt a bit tired
She fixed us a snack
She found him a seat
She gave him a watch
She gave him the car
She got him to drive
She got what he said
She has a big family
She has a funny face
She has a hot temper
She has a kind heart
She has a pure heart
She has a round face
She held up her head
She is a blonde girl
She is a good dancer
She is a good writer
She is a pretty girl
She is a quiet woman
She is a real beauty
She is able to skate
She is angry with me
She is bad at sports
She is first in line
She is hostile to me
She is my dream girl
She is never on time
She is out of danger
She is wearing a hat
She looked up at him
She looks like a boy
She may have said so
She missed him a lot
She must be well off
She ran for the door
She ran out of paper
She seems to be sick
She sent me a letter
She spoke up for him
She told him to stop
She took pity on him
She turned on the TV
She used to date him
She used to hate him
She used to love him
She wants to hug him
She wants to kill me
She went on a picnic
She wore a red dress
Show me a better one
Show me how it works
Sit down and shut up
Someone has to do it
Soon it will be gone
Stay out of the rain
Tell Mary I love her
Tell me a true story
Tell me what you saw
Tell me what you see
Tell me when to stop
Tell me where Tom is
Tell us all about it
Thanks to all of you
That did occur to me
That guy is a bandit
That is a blue house
That was a close one
That was naive of me
The boy began to cry
The car is very fast
The cat is very cute
The coal bin is full
The coat is not mine
The dog nipped at me
The game is not over
The gang is all here
The job is half done
The maid made my bed
The man looked at me
The old man sat down
The party was a flop
The past is the past
The red skirt is new
The sound woke me up
There is a gold coin
They are five in all
They do it each week
They had a good hunt
They had fun with us
They have lost a lot
They live in a house
They sat in a circle
They took a big risk
They want to kill me
They went to the zoo
This book is for you
This car is like new
This essay is my own
This game is so hard
This gift is for you
This is a great book
This is a nice place
This is a rental car
This is a small book
This is good to know
This is my dream job
This is my first day
This is what he said
This must be for you
This pen has run dry
This room is too big
This tea is very hot
This was on the list
Today is not so cold
Tom allowed me to go
Tom can be relied on
Tom got his hair cut
Tom got into the cab
Tom has a point here
Tom has a soft voice
Tom has his own room
Tom has only one leg
Tom hung up his coat
Tom is a bit strange
Tom is a common name
Tom is a good kisser
Tom is a great actor
Tom is a lazy person
Tom is a slow walker
Tom is about my size
Tom is afraid of you
Tom is angry with us
Tom is in the morgue
Tom is in the shower
Tom is just like you
Tom is now in danger
Tom is older than me
Tom is out of danger
Tom is short and fat
Tom is taking a walk
Tom is wiser than me
Tom knew where to go
Tom knows who we are
Tom left Mary a note
Tom lied to the cops
Tom may be a traitor
Tom may not be wrong
Tom said he was busy
Tom said that was OK
Tom says he was busy
Tom sent Mary a gift
Tom tried not to cry
Tom turned on the TV
Tom wants to be rich
Tom wants to meet me
Tom was all worn out
Tom works for me now
Too much is at stake
Try to open the door
We agreed on a price
We all deserve to go
We all want you back
We all work too hard
We are eleven in all
We are out of danger
We can all walk home
We can seat you soon
We got to be friends
We had fun with them
We have faith in Tom
We have to do better
We have to slow down
We have to warn them
We just fed the baby
We know this is real
We lost sight of him
We made quite a team
We make a great team
We may not have time
We meet once a month
We must go to school
We need to cut costs
We need to get going
We ran down the hill
We respect Tom a lot
We see him every day
We should set a trap
We talk all the time
We walked to my room
We want a new carpet
We want to live here
We went to the beach
We went to the river
We were one too many
We work in a factory
What I did was wrong
What we need is help
What you say is true
You are a bad person
You are not a coward
You are not a doctor
You are now an adult
You are what you eat
You can bank on that
You can come with us
You can count on Tom
You can count on her
You can count on him
You can depend on it
You can fix all this
You can sit down now
You go on without me
You got it all wrong
You have not seen it
You have to hurry up
You have to keep fit
You have to stay fit
You have to trust me
You keep out of this
You live in my heart
You look like a girl
You may speak to him
You may use this car
You must not give up
You need to fix this
You need to sober up
You pay me very well
You should go to bed
You should try it on
Your dog is very big
Your dog is very fat
Your son is a genius
A dolphin is a mammal
A little bird told me
A table has four legs
A week has seven days
All of them were gone
All of us were silent
All our money is gone
All the boys ran away
All the eggs went bad
All the food was gone
All the money is gone
All three of us agree
Any child can do that
Any time will suit me
Ask Tom to explain it
Ask Tom where Mary is
Be kind to old people
Be quiet for a moment
Both of you are wrong
Call me at the office
Change was in the air
Come here and help me
Come over to my place
Come to lunch with us
Count from one to ten
Do not be so critical
Do not open your book
Every dog has his day
Find out where Tom is
Get out of my kitchen
Get out while you can
Get your hands off me
Give me just a little
Give me some more tea
Give me your car keys
Give this book to Tom
Glad to see you again
Go ahead and take one
Go and see the doctor
Go back to your seats
He acted as our guide
He and I are teachers
He bowed to the Queen
He broke into a house
He called at my house
He came into the room
He came late as usual
He can no longer wait
He can read and write
He crawled out of bed
He cried out for help
He deals in used cars
He did not mention it
He does not like cats
He drinks like a fish
He drives his own car
He dropped her a line
He earns a great deal
He fell from the tree
He fell off the horse
He felt a sudden pain
He gave me an example
He gave me some money
He got what he wanted
He had a strong alibi
He had the last laugh
He had the right idea
He has a Japanese car
He has a drug allergy
He has a large family
He has a little money
He has a sharp tongue
He has been to France
He has done it before
He has just come back

He is a heroin addict
He is a spoiled child
He is a tennis player
He is afraid of death
He is an army officer
He is away on holiday
He is blinded by love
He is eager to please
He is good at cooking
He is good at driving
He is good at singing
He is in the bathroom
He is just an amateur
He is lost in thought
He is mad about music
He is my close friend
He is no ordinary man
He is not always late
He is not an American
He is on another line
He is sure of success
He is sure to succeed
He is tall and strong
He is the tallest boy
He is washing his car
He is washing the car
He is watching TV now
He is writing a novel
He kept pace with her
He kept staring at me
He knows us very well
He knows who they are
He landed a big trout
He left her all alone
He left the door open
He lied about his age
He likes soccer a lot
He lived a happy life
He lives in a village
He lives off the grid
He looked for the key
He looks kind of pale
He looks like a horse
He lost his new watch
He made up that story
He might not be happy
He moved close to her
He must be over fifty
He must be over sixty
He must be very happy
He must have been ill
He never speaks to me
He picked up the book
He put the phone down
He ran away from home
He reads a great deal
He rested for a while
He robbed an old lady
He sat reading a book
He seems to be asleep
He seems to be honest
He showed her the way
He slipped on the ice
He started a new life
He swims in the river
He tends to tell lies
He threw in the towel
He threw me the apple
He told a funny story
He took a deep breath
He tried to choke him
He turned a blind eye
He turned over in bed
He walked with a limp
He wanted to meet you
He was a rugby player
He was about to speak
He was born in Africa
He was eager for news
He was given the sack
He was hard to please
He was just behind me
He was my best friend
He was sent to prison
He was sick last week
He was staring at her
He was unable to move
He went back to Japan
He went down the hill
He went into the bank
He will be here today
He will get back soon
He will join us later
He will never make it
He will run for mayor
He won a bronze medal
He won the race again
Her life is in danger
His dad calls him Tom
His house is for sale
His life is in danger
His story was made up
I acted on his advice
I agree with his idea
I also wanted to know
I always keep my word
I am an office worker
I am folding my dress
I am grateful to them
I am here on business
I am in the classroom
I am near the station
I am not studying now
I am poor at swimming
I am reading a letter
I am shorter than you
I am tired of reading
I am writing a letter
I assumed it was free
I ate with my parents
I blew the candle out
I bought it last week
I broke my leg skiing
I call her very often
I came back home late
I can hardly hear him
I can hardly hear you
I can open the window
I can play the guitar
I can smell the ocean
I can walk no farther
I can write very fast
I caught the last bus
I chopped a tree down
I come here every day
I could never do that
I did not meet anyone
I did nothing all day
I did the right thing
I dislike all of them
I do feel pretty good
I do have one request
I do not drink coffee
I do not know exactly
I do not like science
I do what is required
I dove into the river
I explained it to him
I feel a little woozy
I feel bad about that
I feel kind of hungry
I feel like going out
I feel much safer now
I feel so much better
I fell into the water
I felt a little dizzy
I felt a little stiff
I forgot all about it
I forgot to tell them
I found the book easy
I found the box empty
I found the empty box
I found the game easy
I gave him my address
I get anything I want
I get the picture now
I get up around seven
I glanced at my watch
I go there every year
I got my ears pierced
I got what you needed
I got what you wanted
I grew up around here
I guess I fell asleep
I guess the dog bites
I guess we were happy
I guess you are right
I had a narrow escape
I had a strange dream
I had my ears checked
I had my eyes checked
I had my money stolen
I had my room cleaned
I had my shoes shined
I had my watch stolen
I had no other choice
I had nothing to hide
I had to do something
I hate guys like that
I have a Japanese car
I have a little fever
I have a little money
I have a student visa
I have a tourist visa
I have an old bicycle
I have been to London
I have borrowed a car
I have done it before
I have errands to run
I have homework to do
I have just come here
I have lost my camera
I have lost my pencil
I have lost my wallet
I have made him angry
I have met her before
I have met him before
I have my own reasons
I have nothing to say
I have plenty of time
I have to be punished
I have to go shopping
I have to keep trying
I heard a funny noise
I heard my phone ring
I heard the door open
I helped fix the leak
I hid behind the tree
I hid under the table
I hope it will change
I hope to return soon
I hope you enjoyed it
I just got your email
I just stubbed my toe
I just want the truth
I just want your love
I just wanted to talk
I knew all about that
I knew it was serious
I knew what Tom meant
I knew what you meant
I know Tom quite well
I know Tom will agree
I know how this works
I know it well enough
I know that Tom knows
I know this will work
I know what they mean
I know what they said
I know what to expect
I know what to ignore
I know where he lives
I know where you live
I know you are clever
I know you helped Tom
I laughed at his joke
I learned a new trick
I learned it from you
I left in the morning
I lent him a magazine
I like all my classes
I like being with you
I like cats very much
I like dogs very much
I like the color blue
I like to be prepared
I like to be thorough
I like to write poems
I live in the country
I lost my credit card
I love a happy ending
I love buying on eBay
I love talking to you
I love to help others
I made a bad decision
I made a couple calls
I made a huge mistake
I made tea last night
I may try again later
I met her by accident
I might not come back
I must be leaving now
I must help my mother
I must hurry to class
I must know the truth
I must repay the debt
I must ride a bicycle
I need it by tomorrow
I need some help here
I need to be prepared
I need to go shopping
I need to keep moving
I never found out why
I never read the book
I never saw Tom again
I never saw her again
I never saw him again
I never told Tom that
I never went to sleep
I no longer live here
I no longer want that
I no longer work here
I often get the blues
I only have ten books
I only need one thing
I ordered you a drink
I owe you a breakfast
I paid for it already
I paid for the damage
I paid for the drinks
I pigged out on pizza
I plan on being early
I play a little piano
I prefer cats to dogs
I prefer dogs to cats
I prefer to eat alone
I promise not to sing
I really am very busy
I really have no idea
I really love my work
I really miss you all
I really need a drink
I really want to stay
I really wanted to go
I refuse to accept it
I remember what I saw
I run my own business
I said leave it alone
I saw my sister there
I should be in charge
I stayed home all day
I stayed home to rest
I stayed up all night
I suggest you go west
I suppose you like it
I tend to catch colds
I think Tom is insane
I think Tom is scared
I think she will come
I think they know you
I think they like you
I think this is funny
I think this is yours
I think we can manage
I think we need those
I think we should run
I think we were lucky
I think you did great
I think you know that
I think you look fine
I think you need help
I think you need this
I think you should go
I thought I heard you
I thought I was alone
I thought I was happy
I thought he had died
I thought he was here
I thought he was rich
I thought it was cool
I thought it was good
I thought it was true
I thought so at first
I turned off my phone
I turned on the radio
I used to play tennis
I used to respect you
I walked about a mile
I want my hammer back
I want to be involved
I want to be pampered
I want to become rich
I want to believe you
I want to leave Paris
I want to lose weight
I want to say goodbye
I want to settle down
I want to visit Korea
I want you back today
I wanted to marry him
I was a bit emotional
I was a healthy child
I was a little afraid
I was angry at myself
I was born in America
I was born in October
I was choked by smoke
I was deceived by him
I was fired last week
I was in good spirits
I was never told that
I was right all along
I was very busy today
I went home and cried
I went out by bicycle
I went to Europe once
I went to the station
I went to your school
I will drive you home
I will make her happy
I will make you happy
I will need your help
I wish I were younger
I wonder where Tom is
I wonder who did that
I wonder who they are
I wonder why Tom left
I work even on Sunday
I work for a hospital
I work in the morning
I would rather go out
I would rather not go
It all depends on Tom
It came as a surprise
It could have been me
It feels like a dream
It gave me the creeps
It is a luxury cruise
It is beyond my power
It is still too early
It is under the chair
It is very cold today
It looks great so far
It made me very happy
It reminded me of you
It started as a hobby
It was a church event
It was a forced smile
It was a huge project
It was a huge success
It was a terrible day
It was hot last night
It was real hard work
It was three days ago
It was time for lunch
It will be ready soon
It will clear up soon
Just do what you want
Just get back to work
Just let me walk away
Just use mine for now
Keep in touch with me
Keep up the good work
Last night I threw up
Lay down on the couch
Let in some fresh air
Let me call my lawyer
Let me deal with this
Let me do the cooking
Let me do the talking
Let me think a minute
Let me think about it
Let some fresh air in
Let them do their job
Life could be so easy
Look at the next page
Make up your own mind
Maybe I need a lawyer
Maybe we can fix this
Maybe you can help us
My back is killing me
My bicycle has a flat
My car is not running
My cat will love this
My college has a dorm
My dad is very strict
My father is a doctor
My left arm is asleep
My life was in danger
My mother is a lawyer
My mother is well off
My nose is stuffed up
My right hand is numb
My room is just below
My room is very small
My shoes are worn out
My sister has a piano
My toe began to bleed
My uncle runs a hotel
My whole body is sore
My wife is very upset
No doubt he will come
No one agreed with me
No one cares about us
No one knows her name
No one knows his name
No one knows the fact
No one listened to me
No one seemed to hear
No one speaks with me
No one wants to fight
No one wants to speak
None of them is alive
None of us is perfect
Not a sound was heard
Not all birds can fly
Not all change is bad
One of my teeth hurts
Our dog has gone away
Our team won the game
Please allow me to go
Please do it this way
Please do not kill me
Please give me a call
Please give me a hand
Please go to the bank
Please let me go home
Please turn on the TV
Price is not an issue
Put it onto the table
Put it where you like
Put the baby to sleep
Put them on the table
Put your coat back on
Red is out of fashion
Say it in another way
Send me a new catalog
She acted in the play
She agreed to my idea
She asked me for help
She beat him to death
She called him a fool
She called him a liar
She came out of there
She can play the drum
She can sew very well
She decided not to go
She does not like him
She gave me a present
She gave us a present
She got home at seven
She handed him a book
She has a good figure
She has a pretty doll
She has a pretty face
She has a small house
She has been to Paris
She has gone to Italy
She hated him so much
She hit the ball hard
She is a good swimmer
She is about to leave
She is afraid of cats
She is afraid of dogs
She is engaged to him
She is good at skiing
She is likely to come
She is related to him
She is sewing a dress
She is weak by nature
She just wrote a book
She lived a long life
She lives in New York
She needs to help him
She picked up a stone
She said with a smile
She seems to be happy
She sings out of tune
She stayed at a hotel
She told him to study
She took off her coat
She took up his offer
She wants to kiss him
She was kissed by him
She was unkind to him
She went to bed early
She wore a pretty hat
She wore a red blouse
Stand the book on end
Stay out of the water
Stocks hit a new high
Take a walk every day
Take hold of the rope
Take me to your place
Tell me what Tom said
Tell me what to think
Tell me what you want
Tell me when to start
Tell the truth to Tom
Tell us the truth now
Thank you all so much
Thanks to both of you
That can be a problem
That car is quite new
That cost him his job
That dog is so stupid
That gave Tom an idea
That guy is an outlaw
That is an old camera
That is an old castle
That is my own affair
That made me very sad
That man is a soldier
That noise woke me up
That one is all yours
That seems like a lot
That was a cheap shot
That was a close call
That was a funny joke
That was kind of mean
That was kind of rude
The baby smiled at me
The black one is mine
The boys built a raft
The circus is in town
The hunter shot a fox
The ice is very thick
The man lost all hope
The moon has come out
The news made her sad
The old man looks sad
The pond has dried up
The pond is very deep
The rain made me late
The rent is very high
The risk is too great
The room is too small
The same goes for Tom
The soap hurt my eyes
The sun has gone down
The sun is rising now
The sun will set soon
The sun will soon set
The tide is coming in
The wind blew all day
There are three of us
There is no milk left
There is no one there
There is no other way
There is no salt left
There was no one home
They are all the same
They are the same age
They did not go there
They ganged up on him
They lie all the time
They made me go there
They meet once a week
They never tell a lie
They sat side by side
They sat under a tree
They sat up all night
They told me about it
They went to bed late
This dog is a mongrel
This guy is an outlaw
This is a Chinese fan
This is a big problem
This is a big project
This is a company car
This is a dirty movie
This is a free ticket
This is a good system
This is a spotted dog
This is all a mistake
This is all our fault
This is an apple tree
This is an epic novel
This is an old letter
This is based on fact
This is for my friend
This is my first time
This is my last offer
This is not my ticket
This is not true love
This is our main goal
This is our only hope
This is the last game
This is the last time
This made me very sad
This movie is rated R
This one is all yours
This room is for VIPs
This room is for rent
This spoon is for tea
This tea is very good
This was a great idea
This was not the deal
Time waits for no one
Today is my lucky day
Today is not your day
Tom and I are buddies
Tom asked for a raise
Tom bought a used car
Tom can count on Mary
Tom caught a big fish
Tom does it very well
Tom gave me this book
Tom gets on my nerves
Tom got a lucky break
Tom grew up in Boston
Tom has a loose tooth
Tom has a thick beard
Tom has lots of money
Tom hid behind a tree
Tom is a bit paranoid
Tom is a fast learner
Tom is a good student
Tom is a handsome guy
Tom is a handsome man
Tom is a sheep farmer
Tom is also an artist
Tom is good at diving
Tom is in big trouble
Tom is in college now
Tom is in there alone
Tom is kind of creepy
Tom is not a criminal
Tom is still in shock
Tom is trying to quit
Tom is writing a book
Tom knows how to dive
Tom liked what he saw
Tom looks like a girl
Tom must be tired now
Tom needed a good job
Tom plugged in the TV
Tom ran at full speed
Tom said he knew Mary
Tom said he would try
Tom says he knows you
Tom set the bird free
Tom taught me to sing
Tom took off his belt
Tom tried to hit Mary
Tom wanted to be sure
Tom wants to help out
Tom wants to know why
Tom was given a medal
Tom was in good shape
Tom was in the shower
Tom was late for work
Tom will stay with us
Tom wrote to a friend
Wait here for a while
We agreed to the plan
We all agree with you
We all have our flaws
We all sang in unison
We are short of money
We are the new owners
We can live with that
We could go there now
We do not accept tips
We had a little water
We have time to spare
We have to be careful
We knelt down to pray
We know all about you
We left the door open
We met at summer camp
We miss you very much
We must do it quickly
We must start at once
We need to study more
We often eat fish raw
We often eat raw fish
We ought to do better
We ran short of money
We really need to win
We really want to win
We should do our best
We should go to sleep
We stood face to face
We tried to stop them
We wear the same size
We will soon take off
We work to earn money
You all did good work
You alone can help me
You are a good person
You are a mean person
You are not a student
You can make your own
You can rely upon him
You gave me your word
You had better go now
You have gone too far
You have not seen him
You have to be strong
You have to hold back
You have to pay taxes
You have to try again
You have to use tools
You live too far away
You look kind of down
You make it look easy
You may take the book
You might not find it
You must come with me
You must do your best
You must go to school
You need not go there
You need to follow me
You need to work fast
You owe him the truth
You reap what you sow
You will stay at home
Your hair is too long
Your room is very big
A child needs a mother
A dust storm is coming
A lot of fish perished
A mosquito just bit me
A rabbit has long ears
A stone does not float
All of them went there
All of us speak French
All roads lead to Rome
All the buses are full
All the girls love Tom
All the lights were on
All the money was gone
An idea occurred to me
Anything is OK with me
Be careful not to fall
Be careful not to slip
Bring me a moist towel
Buy the dress you want
Call me at this number
Call up Tom right away
Charge this bill to me
Come and dance with me
Come back to the party
Come here and sit down
Come over to our table
Dancing is not a crime
Dead men tell no tales
Do not call him master
Easter is near at hand
Enjoy it while you can
Excuse me for a moment
Excuse us for a minute
Father is still in bed
Get a hold of yourself
Get back into your car
Give Tom what he wants
Give it to me straight
Give it your best shot
Give me a final answer
Give me a little money
Give me back my pencil
Give the devil his due
Give this book to Ramu
Go get me another beer
He acted like a madman
He asked for my advice
He asked for the money
He ate the whole apple
He began to cry loudly
He begged for his life
He bought a dozen eggs
He broke out into rage
He broke the door open
He brought us sad news
He called off the trip
He called out for help
He came after you left
He came home very late
He can play the guitar
He can talk to spirits
He did all the legwork
He did nothing but cry
He did the right thing
He died of lung cancer
He dressed like a girl
He dyed his hair black
He earns a good salary
He fell into the ditch
He fell into the river
He gave a vague answer
He gave me some stamps
He gets tough at times
He got his watch fixed
He got the first prize
He had a loving family
He handed in his paper
He has a beautiful tan
He has a bright future
He has a good appetite
He has gone to America
He has gone to Britain
He has left his family
He has no common sense
He has no moral values
He has no real friends
He has no specific aim
He hid behind the door
He hid behind the tree
He is Italian by birth
He is a capable lawyer
He is a complete idiot
He is a good carpenter
He is a lovable person
He is a true gentleman
He is afraid of Father
He is afraid of snakes
He is an office worker
He is crazy about jazz
He is eager to succeed
He is far from perfect
He is fond of painting
He is fond of swimming
He is full of ambition
He is good for nothing
He is guilty of murder
He is having lunch now
He is popular among us
He is riding a bicycle
He is thinking it over
He is thirty years old
He is tired of reading
He jumped on the train
He jumped over a ditch
He kept reading a book
He kept silent all day
He knocked on the door
He knows that you know
He knows the city well
He laughed off my idea
He leads a hectic life
He learned how to swim
He left Japan for good
He left three days ago
He likes to play rough
He likes to read books
He lives near my house
He looked at his watch
He looked into the box
He looks like a monkey
He loved her very much
He loves you very much
He made a bad decision
He married a rich girl
He may have been right
He must be about forty
He never got a holiday
He never said it again
He often appears on TV
He often falls in love
He often goes to Tokyo
He often uses a subway
He ordered a chop suey
He paid the money back
He picked up the phone
He pretends to be deaf
He regrets what he did
He remains sick in bed
He repairs his own car
He sang some old songs
He seemed to like that
He shook hands with me
He should be in charge
He showed me the ropes
He speaks in his sleep
He spoke highly of you
He stayed in the hotel
He still wants to come
He stopped for a smoke
He took a notebook out
He took a step forward
He took out some coins
He turned on the radio
He wants only the best
He was a brave soldier
He was a real drunkard
He was a wonderful man
He was assigned a task
He was dressed in blue
He was drunk and angry
He was frozen to death
He was going to school
He was in good spirits
He was learning a poem
He was petting the dog
He was right after all
He was shorter than me
He was slain in battle
He was voted prom king
He went for the doctor
He went out the window
He went to the dentist
He went to the library
He will come after all
He will come back soon
He will come down soon
He will soon come back
He won the race easily
He won the third prize
He wore a dark sweater
He works like a maniac
He zipped his bag shut
He zipped open his bag
Her friend is a singer
Her hair is very short
His car is really cool
His money was all gone
His music is too noisy
His son died last year
His story must be true
His words came to mind
His words gave me hope
Hope is not a strategy
I actually have to run
I actually saw a ghost
I almost never met her
I am afraid of heights
I am ashamed of myself
I am brushing my teeth
I am doing my homework
I am eating a sandwich
I am leaving next week
I am moving next month
I am off duty tomorrow
I am sixteen years old
I am swamped with work
I am tired of homework
I am worried about him
I approve of your plan
I asked Tom for advice
I asked him a question
I asked what was wrong
I asked you last night
I believe Tom is right
I believe this is mine
I believe what he says
I bought a good camera
I bought a new handbag
I bought lots of books
I bought you a present
I came with my friends
I can handle it myself
I caught an awful cold
I could never harm you
I could never hurt you
I could use some sleep
I cried all night long
I decided to try again
I did do some checking
I do have one question
I enjoy being with you
I enjoyed it very much
I even work on Sundays
I feel great right now
I feel like seeing you
I feel secure with him
I fell asleep in class
I fell down the stairs
I felt guilty about it
I felt the floor shake
I felt the house shake
I figured it out alone
I filled in the blanks
I found a real bargain
I found my car missing
I gather you were hurt
I go skiing very often
I got a traffic ticket
I got it for Christmas
I got lost three times
I got the engine going
I got tired of waiting
I grew up in Australia
I guess I was mistaken
I had a busy afternoon
I had a fantastic time
I had a late breakfast
I had a terrible dream
I had a wonderful time
I had an asthma attack
I had my camera stolen
I had my shoes cleaned
I had my wallet stolen
I had the same thought
I had to defend myself
I had to study English
I had to tell somebody
I hate these new boots
I have a bad toothache
I have a business visa
I have a heart problem
I have a loving family
I have a poor appetite
I have a terrible pain
I have a test tomorrow
I have already done it
I have another job now
I have been busy today
I have done it already
I have heard the story
I have lots of friends
I have many model cars
I have no energy today
I have nothing to lose
I have often been here
I have only just begun
I have only one sister
I have plenty of ideas
I have plenty of money
I have seen her before
I have someplace to go
I have to change tires
I have to leave school
I have to tell someone
I heard a woman scream
I heard my name called
I heard the door close
I hope we achieve that
I just came from there
I just got a promotion
I just needed some air
I just want a vacation
I knew before you knew
I knew he would accept
I knew it would happen
I knew what Tom wanted
I know a little French
I know all the details
I know how women think
I know neither of them
I know she is sleeping
I know where Tom lives
I know where she lives
I know you feel lonely
I learned it in school
I leave in the morning
I left the window open
I like being a teacher
I like dark red better
I like music very much
I like my steak medium
I like neither of them
I like spring the best
I like summer the best
I like that one better
I like the black shoes
I like the color green
I like to grow flowers
I like to travel alone
I live across the hall
I live in an apartment
I live there by myself
I looked in the window
I looked the other way
I lost my favorite pen
I love being a teacher
I love men with beards
I love to eat scallops
I made Tom laugh today
I made a judgment call
I made the woman angry
I make lunch every day
I met an American girl
I must open the window
I must return his call
I need an extra pillow
I never agree with him
I never knew my father
I never read that book
I never think about it
I no longer believe it
I only eat kosher food
I only have one sister
I only slept two hours
I play a little guitar
I prefer coffee to tea
I prefer tea to coffee
I prefer the black one
I prefer to work alone
I promise to work hard
I promised not to tell
I quite agree with you
I read the entire book
I really like that car
I really like that guy
I really like this car
I really like this one
I really must be going
I refuse to allow this
I remember both of you
I run a small business
I saw Tom hitting Mary
I saw a beautiful bird
I shook hands with Tom
I should get back home
I should get some rest
I should read the book
I slept just two hours
I speak for all people
I speak only the truth
I spoke with Tom today
I spoke with my family
I studied for one hour
I study French at home
I study at the library
I study hard at school
I suppose you like her
I suppose you like him
I suppose you love her
I suppose you love him
I sure miss my friends
I think Tom got scared
I think Tom is nervous
I think Tom is serious
I think Tom is unlucky
I think Tom loves Mary
I think Tom wants more
I think about it often
I think that went well
I think this will work
I think we should quit
I think we should talk
I think we should wait
I think you look great
I think you were right
I thought Tom was sick
I thought it was funny
I thought she was cute
I thought she was sick
I thought you hated me
I thought you liked me
I tried to act natural
I tried to protect you
I try to be aggressive
I turned off the radio
I turned on the lights
I used to wear glasses
I want a status report
I want my bicycle back
I want this one myself
I want to learn French
I want to learn Hebrew
I want to learn Korean
I want to learn karate
I want to live forever
I want to stay outside
I want to study French
I want to study German
I want to surprise him
I was hungry and angry
I was invited to lunch
I was just making sure
I was not feeling well
I was right behind Tom
I was there last night
I was thrown off guard
I was very tired today
I was watching TV then
I was wrong about that
I was young and stupid
I watch lots of movies
I went a different way
I went over the report
I went straight to bed
I went to the hospital
I will be more careful
I will be very careful
I will gladly help you
I will not be defeated
I wish Tom would hurry
I work as a consultant
I worked all this week
I would like this book
I would never go there
Iron is a useful metal
It all makes sense now
It brings me great joy
It gives me the creeps
It had started to rain
It happened in a flash
It is finally all over
It is not his business
It is raining hard now
It is their last movie
It is to his advantage
It just makes no sense
It looks good on paper
It looks like an apple
It makes me feel dirty
It may rain any minute
It means nothing to me
It might not be enough
It might not even work
It seems logical to me
It seems to be serious
It seems to be working
It should be like this
It sounds like a dream
It varies a great deal
It was a bold decision
It was a judgment call
It was a weird feeling
It was a wise decision
It was all for nothing
It was chilly that day
It was hard to believe
It was never like that
It was not an accident
It was truly a miracle
It was your own choice
Just get off the stage
Just tell us the truth
Keep away from the dog
Keep up with the times
Keep your hands off me
Let me check my wallet
Let me join your cause
Let me see your tongue
Let me think this over
Let me write that down
Let them do their jobs
Let us finish our work
Lie on your right side
Life is like a journey
Look in the phone book
Look out of the window
Love is hard to define
Maybe I drink too much
My GPS works very well
My TV has quit working
My body aches all over
My brother is an idiot
My cat is following me
My cat is really smart
My cats will love this
My dad bought me books
My dad gave up alcohol
My door is always open
My dream has come true
My family are all well
My father is a teacher
My father is very nice
My father was an actor
My father will kill me
My feet are killing me
My friend is beside me
My friends call me Tom
My heart began to race
My house faces the sea
My house is like yours
My house is your house
My life is almost over
My mother cooks for me
My mother cut the cake
My mother is a teacher
My mother was in tears
My nails are too short
My nose was very runny
My room is number five
My shoes are too tight
My son is a journalist
My time is running out
My uncle drives a Ford
My wife died of cancer
My wife stayed at home
Never tell a lie again
No one agreed with him
No one can replace you
No one could deny this
No one else knows this
No one ever comes here
No one knows the cause
No one will believe me
No one will believe us
Nobody came to help me
Nobody knows it but me
Our team did very well
Please add up the bill
Please give him a call
Please give me a break
Please turn off the TV
Put your room in order
Save me some ice cream
See things as they are
See you in the morning
Selling cars is my job
She always stood by me
She asked him for help
She asked us to dinner
She begged him to stay
She bowed deeply to me
She came into the room
She came late as usual
She can play the piano
She can sing very well
She dressed like a boy
She fell from the tree
She gave him a massage
She gave him a present
She gave him a sweater
She gave him some food
She got engaged to him
She got married to him
She had a little money
She had her dress made
She had white shoes on
She handed him the key
She has a little bread
She has a sharp tongue
She has never seen him
She hung up in silence
She is a famous singer
She is a gifted artist
She is cooking for him
She is fond of animals
She is great at skiing
She is guilty of fraud
She is guilty of theft
She is his real mother
She is used to cooking
She is used to sitting
She knit him a sweater
She let the secret out
She lied about her age
She lived a happy life
She lived to be ninety
She lost her new watch
She married a rich man
She may be our teacher
She must be very happy
She picked me an apple
She put on her sweater
She really wants to go
She said she was happy
She sang as she walked
She says she will come
She sent him a message
She showed me her room
She smiled at her baby
She started at the top
She stood close to him
She told me her secret
She took a deep breath
She tried a third time
She used to drink beer
She wanted to be alone
She was about to leave
She was born last year
She was dressed in red
She was pale with fear
She went there to swim
She will get well soon
She wore a white dress
Smoking is a bad habit
Someone is at the door
Stay out of my kitchen
Take aim at the target
Take me to your leader
Take the money and run
Tell Tom what you mean
Tell me what you think
Tell me where you went
Tell me which you want
Tell us all the gossip
Ten years have gone by
Tennis is loads of fun
Thank you ever so much
Thank you for the link
That better not be Tom
That boy is really shy
That cost me a fortune
That house is for rent
That house is for sale
That is a leather belt
That is an actual fact
That is not your knife
That looks good on you
That looks kind of fun
That person is like me
That was a great movie
That was a great party
That was a nice speech
That would be very sad
The baby is growing up
The boss is very upset
The boy is very honest
The bus will come soon
The cat caught a mouse
The cat ruined my sofa
The clouds hid the sun
The day is almost over
The dog must be hungry
The dog ran towards me
The door may be locked
The door was wide open
The door will not open
The eggs are still hot
The first time is free
The girl has no mother
The hunter shot a bear
The job is almost done
The knife is not sharp
The lights are all off
The line is busy again
The man died of cancer
The man robbed her bag
The news made me happy
The old book was moldy
The plan was a success
The rain began to fall
The rain lasted a week
The real heroes are us
The river is deep here
The shoes are worn out
The snow was knee deep
The statue has no head
The steak is well done
The tea is boiling hot
The train came on time
The train left on time
The wind has died down
The wind is cold today
Their loss is our gain
There is no dress code
There is no going back
There is no sugar here
There is no wind today
There is not much hope
There was no one about
These all belong to me
They agreed on a price
They all look the same
They are jealous of us
They basked in the sun
They chose me for that
They cut down the tree
They got into the boat
They had no money left
They have an extra bed
They have no more wine
They hid in the cellar
They left him for dead
They let her marry him
They live in a commune
They live in a mansion
They live in this town
They make a great team
They say love is blind
They seem to trust you
They talk all the time
They went to the beach
They will be very glad
Things got out of hand
This CD belongs to her
This coat fits me well
This doll has big eyes
This exam is very easy
This food is too salty
This guy is really hot
This house is for rent
This is a good bargain
This is a great theory
This is a major crisis
This is a public beach
This is a wooden table
This is all so strange
This is all your fault
This is an ancient law
This is kind of boring
This is my final offer
This is my old bicycle
This is not a hospital
This is not a sentence
This is out of control
This is the last straw
This is the last train
This is the real world
This is where he lives
This is your lucky day
This job has no future
This job is killing me
This joke is not funny
This land is your land
This looks like a trap
This meat has gone bad
This must be a mistake
This pen belongs to me
This plan has no flaws
This reminds me of Tom
This reminds me of you
This room is very warm
This shoe fits me well
This soup is too spicy
This spoon is for soup
This tea is too bitter
This thin book is mine
This was a long letter
Time is of the essence
Tom also has a brother
Tom amazes me at times
Tom and Mary have gone
Tom and Mary were busy
Tom backed up his data
Tom could go to prison
Tom dyed his hair blue
Tom fell off the chair
Tom gave me this watch
Tom had a panic attack
Tom had nothing to say
Tom has never met Mary
Tom has written a book
Tom insisted that I go
Tom is a Boston native
Tom is an avid cyclist
Tom is close to thirty
Tom is doing great now
Tom is doing just fine
Tom is good at biology
Tom is good at writing
Tom is in great danger
Tom is married to Mary
Tom is no ordinary man
Tom is older than Mary
Tom is on life support
Tom is our best player
Tom is our team leader
Tom is perfect for you
Tom is someone I trust
Tom is waiting for you
Tom is walking his dog
Tom is yelling at Mary
Tom knows what you did
Tom makes me feel safe
Tom means what he says
Tom met John in prison
Tom might be a traitor
Tom never did it again
Tom pulled out his gun
Tom said he enjoyed it
Tom said he was afraid
Tom slept on the train
Tom split up with Mary
Tom stared at his feet
Tom told me about Mary
Tom took a cold shower
Tom took off his shirt
Tom took the wrong bus
Tom tried to keep calm
Tom tried to save Mary
Tom wants to be famous
Tom wants to say hello
Tom was killed by Mary
Tom was kissed by Mary
Tom was like a brother
Tom was reading a book
Tom will never give up
Tom will never make it
Tomorrow is my day off
Watch out for that man
We acted in good faith
We agree on this point
We all have missed you
We all have our orders
We can make some money
We could be happy here
We danced to the music
We do need your advice
We had a narrow escape
We had some good times
We have an orange tree
We have no extra money
We have plenty of time
We have plenty of wine
We have to act quickly
We have to be cautious
We have to go shopping
We heard the door shut
We know all about that
We live in the suburbs
We make sake from rice
We may still get lucky
We met her by accident
We must obey the rules
We need some help here
We need to be prepared
We need to go shopping
We played on the beach
We prefer to stay here
We ran after the thief
We ran around the park
We walked to the river
We want our money back
We will make it public
We will win the battle
We would like to leave
What she said is wrong
What you did was wrong
Women are all the same
You are a good student
You are my best friend
You are not our friend
You are taller than me
You are the chosen one
You can read this book
You can take your time
You can use my bicycle
You could have told me
You have a good memory
You have a point there
You have changed a lot
You have to be careful
You have to be patient
You knew I was married
You know what they say
You leave me no choice
You look just like him
You look like a baboon
You look like your dad
You made a big mistake
You made a wise choice
You may kiss the bride
You might have told me
You must do it quickly
You must do this alone
You must meet with her
You must meet with him
You must start at once
You need to be careful
You need to study more
You never get my jokes
You never told me that
You ought to thank him
You owe Tom an apology
You should be a writer
You should go home now
You should relax a bit
You should stay in bed
You should talk to Tom
You stay away from her
You took the wrong key
You were late for work
You will soon get well
Your life is in danger
A cold wind was blowing
A fire broke out nearby
A horse passed my house
A promise is not enough
A square has four sides
All my friends like Tom
All my friends say that
All my homework is done
All of us were homesick
All of you look healthy
All our food was rotten
All the boxes are empty
All the lights went out
All the rooms are taken
Any child could do that
Apples are red or green
Ask her what she bought
Ask me again in October
Be kind to the children
Be nicer to your sister
Beauty is but skin deep
Black cats are bad luck
Blame it on the weather
Carry on with your work
Charge it to my account
China is a huge country
Choose a dress you like
Choose the one you like
Come down from the tree
Cut the pie into slices
Europe is not a country
Even a child knows that
Every man has his price
Father is angry with me
Father is having a bath
Father is in his office
Fill the tires with air
Get me something to eat
Give Tom back his money
Give me a ring tomorrow
Give me a second chance
Give me all the details
Give me back my glasses
Give me one good reason
Give us a ride downtown
Glass is made from sand
Guess what that cost me
Hawks are birds of prey
He acted like a lunatic
He added to his savings
He and I are classmates
He asked for more money
He asked for some money
He behaved like a child
He behaves like a child
He bought her a sweater
He bought himself a dog
He bowed to his teacher
He broke his leg skiing
He called her bad names
He came back after dark
He came back from China
He carried out his plan
He caught a large trout
He chose them at random
He cleared out his desk
He continued to mock me
He cut down on drinking
He decided to marry her
He does not like tennis
He does nothing but cry
He does well in physics
He drinks too much beer
He dropped to his knees
He drowned in the river
He finally got his wish
He fought until the end
He found out the secret
He goes there every day
He got across the river
He got tired of reading
He got what he deserved
He happened to be there
He has a pleasant voice
He has a tight schedule
He has already gone out
He has already said yes
He has come from Boston
He has gone to Hokkaido
He has no more strength
He has seen better days
He has to speak English
He has written a letter
He is Japanese by birth
He is a famous composer
He is a friendly person
He is a great scientist
He is a medical student
He is a tennis champion
He is boiling with rage
He is drawing a picture
He is fluent in Chinese
He is fluent in English
He is fond of adventure
He is hated by everyone
He is having coffee now
He is known to everyone
He is not himself today
He is poor at chemistry
He is putting on weight
He is quite a gentleman
He is respected by them
He is smelling the soup
He is tall and handsome
He is used to traveling
He keeps his room clean
He kept on telling lies
He left the window open
He lives here all alone
He lives near the beach
He lives on this street
He made a grave mistake
He made her a bookshelf
He mailed a letter home
He married a local girl
He never keeps his word
He never loses his head
He never stops to think
He no longer lives here
He no longer works here
He objected to our plan
He plays the piano well
He plugged in the radio
He promised not to tell
He pulled open the door
He put the luggage down
He reached for the book
He really ticked me off
He saved me from danger
He seems to be friendly
He seems unable to swim
He squashed my hat flat
He stamped out the fire
He stood all by himself
He stuck to his promise
He thinks he knows best
He thought up an excuse
He took advantage of me
He took off his clothes
He took off his glasses
He took the first prize
He turned off the light
He was a Roman Catholic
He was a great musician
He was a trusted friend
He was accused of theft
He was acting on orders
He was born in Nagasaki
He was brought to tears
He was checking you out
He was covered with mud
He was crushed to death
He was guilty of murder
He was not feeling well
He was seized with fear
He was sent into combat
He was supposed to come
He went there in person
He whistled for his dog
He will always be there
He will always love her
He will be back shortly
Her daughter is a nurse
Here is my phone number
His daughter is a nurse
His mother was a singer
Hold it with both hands
I admit I was surprised
I almost never watch TV
I already gave you half
I always walk to school
I am an English teacher
I am disgusted with him
I am eighteen years old
I am following that car
I am not going anywhere
I am reading a magazine
I am the fastest runner
I asked where she lived
I ate a turkey sandwich
I baked it this morning
I brought you a present
I brought you red roses
I call her pretty often
I can hardly believe it
I could hardly hear him
I could use some advice
I cried on his shoulder
I danced all night long
I did a little research
I do not understand her
I do not understand you
I do think I understand
I eat dinner after work
I eat there every night
I enjoy being a teacher
I enjoy eating with you
I envy your good health
I feel a little awkward
I feel awful about that
I feel kind of nauseous
I feel like an impostor
I feel like an outsider
I feel like being alone
I feel like throwing up
I feel lost without you
I feel relaxed with you
I felt myself lifted up
I finally found my keys
I flunked out of school
I folded all the towels
I forgot all about that
I forgot the PIN number
I found my bicycle gone
I found the book boring
I gave you fair warning
I got one for Christmas
I had a bad stomachache
I had a happy childhood
I had a nosebleed today
I had a quick breakfast
I had my bicycle stolen
I had no visitors today
I had no work yesterday
I had the door repaired
I hate the weather here
I have a tight schedule
I have a weird neighbor
I have an ear infection
I have an exam tomorrow
I have an older brother
I have done my homework
I have finished my work
I have just eaten lunch
I have little money now
I have lost my umbrella
I have no time tomorrow
I have often been there
I have to take medicine
I have to work tomorrow
I have two big brothers
I heard a noise outside
I heard a strange sound
I hope it stops raining
I just feel so helpless
I just got your message
I just like to daydream
I knew it was unhealthy
I knew something was up
I knew they were coming
I know a little Spanish
I know his brother well
I know myself very well
I know nothing about it
I know nothing but this
I know someone was here
I learned from the best
I let my teammates down
I like hanging out here
I like shopping on Ebay
I like singing with Tom
I like skiing very much
I like tennis very much
I like to draw pictures
I like to study English
I like working with you
I listened to her story
I listened to his story
I live three doors down
I locked the front door
I looked at the picture
I looked out the window
I lost everything I had
I love being around him
I love to take pictures
I met him several times
I must be getting close
I need an extra blanket
I need some good advice
I need something to eat
I need to get something
I never do any exercise
I never really knew Tom
I never thought of that
I never visit my sister
I often have bad dreams
I only went inside once
I paid him five dollars
I painted the gate blue
I passed by four houses
I play volleyball a lot
I prefer mutton to beef
I prefer spring to fall
I put it here somewhere
I really like city life
I really like that girl
I really like your work
I really need the money
I really need your help
I refuse to accept that
I refuse to answer that
I refused to believe it
I regret having said so
I saw him play baseball
I saw somebody kiss Tom
I scarcely slept a wink
I slept aboard the ship
I slept well last night
I sold my books cheaply
I speak a few languages
I speak a little German
I stared at the ceiling
I still believe in love
I stretched out my legs
I study English at home
I suggest we get moving
I suggest you get going
I suppose it might work
I suppose we could walk
I suppose you are right
I swim almost every day
I think I am overworked
I think I see something
I think I understand it
I think Tom believed me
I think Tom is cheating
I think Tom is generous
I think Tom is impolite
I think Tom is reliable
I think Tom is sleeping
I think about Tom often
I think about her often
I think about him often
I think about you often
I think he will succeed
I think my parents know
I think this is perfect
I think you should quit
I think you should swim
I thought I heard music
I thought he might come
I thought he was honest
I thought he would come
I thought it was stupid
I thought nothing of it
I thought this was mine
I thought we could talk
I thought we were happy
I thought you went home
I thought you were dead
I told everyone to duck
I tried again and again
I turned the lights out
I understand it all now
I used to love swimming
I usually do the dishes
I want something to eat
I want this room sealed
I want to eat something
I want to learn English
I want to press charges
I want to study English
I want to study history
I wanted to go swimming
I wanted to impress you
I wanted to protect you
I wanted to slap myself
I was not studying then
I was really very happy
I was speaking with Tom
I was taken by surprise
I was worried about you
I watched it on YouTube
I went fishing with Tom
I will always love Mary
I will ask him tomorrow
I will make some coffee
I wonder how that works
I work during the night
I work in this building
I worry about my future
It all seems so strange
It could be big trouble
It feels like an orange
It gives me the shivers
It happens all the time
It is not for beginners
It is pretty cold today
It is pretty warm today
It is rather warm today
It is their only choice
It looks a little heavy
It may freeze next week
It may rain around noon
It needs to be repaired
It should be no problem
It snowed for four days
It took exactly an hour
It was a perfect moment
It was a strange affair
It was an exciting game
It was not my intention
It was obviously a joke
It was quiet all around
It went without a hitch
It will be hot tomorrow
Japan is a rich country
Just let me handle this
Just shut up and listen
Just take a deep breath
Just tell him the truth
Keep away from the fire
Life is a great mystery
Lock the door behind me
London is on the Thames
Look at all these boxes
Look at that big hammer
Look at the setting sun
Luck turned in my favor
Making cheese is an art
Many of the people died
Mary dyed her hair blue
Mary needs a dozen eggs
Most boys know his name
Most of the plants died
My arm is hurting badly
My bedroom is too small
My body itches all over
My boss was very strict
My brother has no money
My father gets up early
My father is very tired
My father was a teacher
My hair is getting long
My mother gets up early
My mother made me study
My mother set the table
My room has two windows
My room is always clean
My sister has long legs
My sister is bugging me
My strength is all gone
My uncle died of cancer
My uncle made a fortune
My wife is a vegetarian
My wife loves apple pie
My wife works part time
Next year will be worse
No one else was injured
No one knows the answer
No one knows the reason
No one knows their name
No one voted against it
No one will believe him
No one will believe you
No proof was ever found
Nobody came to help him
Nobody knew what to say
Nobody knows how I feel
Nobody wants to do that
Not every bird can sing
Oil will float on water
Paper is made from wood
Pardon me for saying so
Peel two of the bananas
People want to own land
Perhaps you can beat me
Please ask Tom to leave
Please bring me my bill
Please call me a doctor
Please come and help me
Please come to my house
Please keep it a secret
Please lend me your car
Please pass me the salt
Please say hello to her
Please show me the menu
Please sum up your idea
Please tell him to wait
Please tell me about it
Please write with a pen
Poland is a big country
Quit acting like a baby
Raise up your left hand
She aimed at the target
She always got up early
She always smiles at me
She and I usually agree
She answered with a nod
She asked me a question
She bought a dozen eggs
She bought him a camera
She bought him a ticket
She burst into the room
She came with good news
She does not like sushi
She forgot to write him
She gave a vague answer
She gave me good advice
She had a narrow escape
She had a perfect alibi
She hardly talks at all
She has a beautiful tan
She has a large mansion
She has to stop smoking
She ignored him all day
She is a charming woman
She is a cheerful giver
She is a selfish person
She is a wonderful wife
She is dressed in white
She is eighteen at most
She is good at swimming
She is his present wife
She is knitting a scarf
She is listening to him
She is not always happy
She is shy of strangers
She is wearing a brooch
She keeps her hair long
She kept silent all day
She knocked on the door
She lay awake all night
She led a solitary life
She lent me her bicycle
She liked him right off
She likes to read books
She lived a lonely life
She looks like her aunt
She makes a good living
She married a local boy
She may spill the beans
She must be over eighty
She picked up the phone
She really ate too much
She resides in New York
She runs a dance studio
She scared the cat away
She sent him a postcard
She showed me her album
She showed me his album
She struggled to get up
She took me by surprise
She wanted to help them
She was aching all over
She was only half alive
She waved goodbye to me
She wore a simple dress
Shoes are sold in pairs
Show me what you bought
Sign on the dotted line
Stay a while and listen
Stay away from my woman
Stay away from the fire
Stay out of my business
Stop acting like a baby
Stop acting like a jerk
Stop crying like a girl
Supper is a simple meal
Swimming is easy for me
Sydney is far from here
Take heed of her advice
Take things as they are
Tell me a bedtime story
Tell me about your plan
Tell me about your wife
Tell me all the details
Tell me where she lives
Thank you all very much
Thank you for your gift
Thank you for your help
Thank you for your time
Thank you just the same
Thanks for all the fish
That applies to him too
That boy has black hair
That boy is his brother
That boy is very clever
That boy looks like Tom
That boy showed no fear
That dog is really ugly
That dog runs very fast
That girl is really shy
That is an absolute lie
That is how it happened
That is simply not true
That man stole my purse
That never was an issue
That painting is a copy
That remains to be seen
That reminds me of home
That was quite a speech
That was the basic idea
That would be a mistake
That would be all right
That would take all day
The acting is very good
The baby is fast asleep
The baby started to cry
The box is almost empty
The boy feared the dark
The brown horse is fast
The car bumped the tree
The cat arched its back
The desk drawer is open
The door would not open
The facts are not clear
The game was called off
The goods arrive by sea
The ground is still wet
The guests are all gone
The hawk caught a mouse
The hotel is down there
The house has been sold
The house is farther on
The house was in flames
The lady is over eighty
The lock must be broken
The man is eating bread
The meeting is all over
The moon is already out
The news made her happy
The old man looked wise
The party ended at nine
The party was a failure
The party was a success
The police are after me
The radio will not work
The risks are too great
The road was very bumpy
The room is quite small
The rooms are all clean
The storm has died down
The storm sank the boat
The tide is rising fast
The tree grew very tall
The water began to boil
The water turned to ice
The weather is very bad
The weather is very hot
The wheel began to turn
There are no drugs here
There is no breeze here
There is plenty of food
There must be a pattern
There was only one left
These gifts are for you
These keys are not mine
These pants fit me well
These shoes fit my feet
They all deserve to die
They are about to start
They are all very happy
They are making a salad
They ate and drank wine
They drank way too much
They formed a swim team
They gave us their word
They got into the train
They have a large house
They lived a happy life
They met in high school
They refused to help us
They rowed up the river
They tried a third time
They want you to resign
They were afraid of you
They were in the shower
They were put in prison
They will agree on that
They work in the fields
This book is a whodunit
This book is really old
This book is very small
This chair is too small
This could take a while
This cow is not branded
This does not bode well
This door will not open
This house is very good
This is a Japanese doll
This is a good textbook
This is a great victory
This is against the law
This is almost too easy
This is how it happened
This is my new tricycle
This is not about money
This is not our problem
This is our last chance
This is simply not true
This is the zoom button
This is what he painted
This knot will not hold
This looks kind of cute
This place is all right
This program is a rerun
This reminds me of home
This sounds like a trap
This steak is too tough
This will keep you warm
This would be a mistake
Those pants are too big
Tom and I are separated
Tom and Mary are asleep
Tom asked for my number
Tom beat Mary in tennis
Tom began to feel tired
Tom bought me this book
Tom built his own house
Tom called in an expert
Tom dove into the water
Tom drank too much wine
Tom forgot to buy bread
Tom found out the truth
Tom got engaged to Mary
Tom got on the airplane
Tom had a difficult job
Tom has a difficult job
Tom has a secret weapon
Tom has been helping me
Tom has his own bedroom
Tom has joined the army
Tom has long blond hair
Tom has made a decision
Tom has no common sense
Tom hid under the table
Tom is a little nervous
Tom is allergic to dust
Tom is allergic to eggs
Tom is an active person
Tom is biting his nails
Tom is full of ambition
Tom is learning to swim
Tom is living in Boston
Tom is looking for Mary
Tom is obviously a jerk
Tom is scared of ghosts
Tom is thirty years old
Tom is tidying his room
Tom kept silent all day
Tom knows Mary is right
Tom knows where we live
Tom looked at the floor
Tom lost a contact lens
Tom makes me feel young
Tom never makes his bed
Tom never saw her again
Tom never talks to Mary
Tom pounded on the door
Tom pulled out a pencil
Tom put on his backpack
Tom put on some clothes
Tom ran to the bathroom
Tom regrets what he did
Tom said Mary was happy
Tom sat behind his desk
Tom sat in the darkness
Tom says he saw nothing
Tom seems to be nervous
Tom seems to be seasick
Tom still lives at home
Tom still loves his job
Tom taught Mary to read
Tom threw Mary the ball
Tom took a quick shower
Tom tried to stay quiet
Tom turned on the light
Tom used to play soccer
Tom wanted to be famous
Tom wanted to call Mary
Tom wanted to help Mary
Tom wants to marry Mary
Tom was a piano teacher
Tom was dying of thirst
Tom was late for dinner
Tom was looking for you
Tom was right after all
Tom was scared to death
Tom was sure of himself
Tom was talking to Mary
Tom watches too much TV
Tom went home with Mary
Tom wishes he could fly
Tom works at a pizzeria
Tom wrung out the towel
Toss your gun over here
Try to hold it together
Turn the flame down low
Turn the lights out now
Wait until you see this
We all deserve a chance
We all have our secrets
We all wished for peace
We are free from danger
We bought a round table
We can open the windows
We can rest after lunch
We depend on each other
We discussed what to do
We drove into the night
We felt the house shake
We got stuck in traffic
We had a large audience
We had a little problem
We had a secret meeting
We had a wonderful time
We had to react quickly
We have a holiday today
We have a mutual friend
We have all the details
We have dinner at seven
We have no other choice
We have no other option
We have no school today
We have seen three wars
We have snow in January
We have three days left
We heard the door close
We left four days later
We left the movie early
We live in an apartment
We live near the border
We looked at each other
We may not win tomorrow
We must always be ready
We need some more water
We need to call someone
We never got the chance
We never work on Sunday
We sat in total silence
We should do that again
We should do this again
We should hang out more
We should wait a little
We skied down the slope
We still can’t see it
We still need your help
We were looking for Tom
We will be back tonight
We will visit them soon
Well begun is half done
What I wanted was water
What we want is freedom
Write to him right away
You are a good customer
You are blinded by love
You are only young once
You can always text Tom
You can get dressed now
You could well be right
You did the right thing
You go there without me
You got what you wanted
You have done very well
You have very nice lips
You have very sexy legs
You left your lights on
You look a little green
You may open the window
You may use his library
You might not like this
You must do it yourself
You must have lost them
You must pay in advance
You must read this book
You nearly broke my jaw
You need to be prepared
You need to lose weight
You never know for sure
You ought to be ashamed
You owe me thirty bucks
You said you were happy
You seemed to like that
You should do that soon
You should get up early
You should have done so
You should have seen it
You should have seen me
You should listen to me
You should not go alone
You should not go there
You should see a doctor
You take my breath away
You two are really kind
You were almost in time
You will miss the train
You would be safe there
A baby has delicate skin
A gentle wind is blowing
A light bulb gives light
A light rain was falling
All but one were present
All my problems are over
All our plans went wrong
All that has changed now
All the boys looked down
All the seats are booked
All these books are mine
All this has now changed
All those books are mine
Anger showed on his face
Ask me anything you like
Be nicer to your brother
Beauty is only skin deep
Bread is made from wheat
Bring me some cold water
Butter is made from milk
Cabbage can be eaten raw
Cheese is made from milk
Choose any of these pens
Close the door after you
Come and keep me company
Come and see me tomorrow
Come as soon as possible
Cows supply us with milk
Crime is on the increase
Do not disobey the rules
Do whatever he tells you
Drugs can ruin your life
Every house had a garden
Excuse me for being late
Excuse me for one moment
Fill the jars with water
Five plus three is eight
Flour is made from wheat
Flour is made into bread
Get down from your horse
Get out of the classroom
Give him my best regards
Give me something to eat
Go ahead with your story
Go and help your brother
Greed is not always good
He and I walked together
He arrived late as usual
He asked after my mother
He asked for a cigarette
He became a famous actor
He began to make excuses
He believed in the truth
He bought us some drinks
He came back last August
He came here before noon
He consented on the spot
He cut the envelope open
He danced all night long
He denied having done it
He denied having met her
He denies having done it
He did not like children
He died before I arrived
He drives a hard bargain
He drives a pickup truck
He dwells in the country
He found the door closed
He found the door locked
He grinned broadly at us
He had a rough childhood
He had been there before
He had dinner by himself
He had his wallet stolen
He has a friendly nature
He has a generous nature
He has a good reputation
He has a small advantage
He has already gone home
He has already had lunch
He has broken the record
He has never been abroad
He has never hurt anyone
He has never played golf
He has nobody to consult
He has not yet succeeded
He has written two books
He heard his name called
He heard the dog barking
He insulted me in public
He intended to marry her
He is a typical Japanese
He is absent from school
He is afraid of swimming
He is an intelligent boy
He is being very careful
He is crazy about skiing
He is fresh from college
He is good at gymnastics
He is impossible to beat
He is known to everybody
He is liked by everybody
He is opening the window
He is painting a picture
He is selfish and greedy
He is stronger than ever
He jumped into the water
He jumped out the window
He keeps this gun loaded
He kept reading the book
He left Japan for Europe
He likes games of chance
He likes music very much
He lived an unhappy life
He lives in an apartment
He lives with his mother
He longed for his mother
He looked at her angrily
He looked over my report
He looks like his father
He looks much better now
He lost his movie ticket
He made friends with Tom
He married a pretty girl
He might change his mind
He missed the last train
He must be the principal
He never talked about it
He often calls her names
He often walks to school
He opened his mouth wide
He painted the door blue
He plays chess very well
He plays poker with them
He plays the guitar well
He promised to marry her
He put on clean trousers
He quit school last week
He really makes me angry
He ripped his shirt open
He seldom goes to church
He shooed the flies away
He slammed his door shut
He slept well last night
He spends too much money
He studied for ten years
He thanked me for coming
He took off his overcoat
He took on extra workers
He tried to kill himself
He usually comes in time
He waited until she came
He wants to be different
He was accused of murder
He was beaten too easily
He was exposed to danger
He was hanged for murder
He was held in captivity
He was humiliated by her
He was paralyzed by fear
He was passive by nature
He was playing the piano
He went aboard the plane
He went there by himself
He whipped out his sword
He who hesitates is lost
He will be busy tomorrow
He will keep us informed
He will love her forever
He works as a translator
He works the night shift
He wrote to me yesterday
Help me lift the package
Help yourself to a drink
Her face beamed with joy
Her family is very large
Her hair is turning gray
Her house is very modern
Her name slipped my mind
His clothes are worn out
His courage won him fame
His debts were piling up
His family is very large
His house is very modern
His new car is wonderful
His overcoat is worn out
His patience is worn out
His work is washing cars
Hunger is the best sauce
I admire your work ethic
I agree to your proposal
I agreed to the proposal
I almost dropped a plate
I am free this afternoon
I am interested in music
I am playing video games
I appreciate all you did
I assumed you were happy
I assumed you would come
I ate breakfast at eight
I ate too much yesterday
I began living by myself
I believe you are honest
I bought an electric car
I bought her some drinks
I brought you some lunch
I brought you some water
I came down with measles
I came home empty handed
I can solve this problem
I caught Tom by surprise
I come here every Monday
I could find his address
I could have been killed
I did everything I could
I did everything for you
I did that earlier today
I did what was necessary
I do hope you understand
I do sympathize with you
I dropped out of college
I enjoy talking with you
I enjoyed talking to him
I expected better of Tom
I expected better of him
I expected better of you
I feel a little insecure
I feel cold this morning
I feel like another beer
I feel much better today
I finally bought the toy
I followed all the rules
I forgot to do something
I found her very amusing
I found his house easily
I fully intend to return
I gave up eating dessert
I get depressed at times
I got up early yesterday
I had a family emergency
I had a mental breakdown
I hardly see you anymore
I hate waiting like this
I hate when that happens
I hate when this happens
I have a good dictionary
I have a serious problem
I have a slight headache
I have an audition today
I have an identical twin
I have another good idea
I have confidence in him
I have everything I need
I have just arrived here
I have no homework today
I have no plans whatever
I have plenty of friends
I have to change clothes
I hear you were grounded
I heard an unusual noise
I heard the boys singing
I hope someone sees this
I invited all my friends
I just have one question
I just needed some water
I just want some answers
I just want to disappear
I knew this would happen
I know I heard something
I know nothing about her
I learn French at school
I left the door unlocked
I like English very much
I like music and English
I like playing the piano
I like talking to people
I like to be spontaneous
I like walking by myself
I liked working with you
I live across the street
I live three blocks away
I lost your phone number
I love my yellow sweater
I love trying new things
I love watching you cook
I made a serious mistake
I met the prince himself
I must answer her letter
I must have it shortened
I must help these people
I must renew my passport
I need a good dictionary
I need an extension cord
I need to learn Japanese
I never learned to write
I never thought about it
I never use this anymore
I no longer study French
I opened the door slowly
I owe you an explanation
I paid for these tickets
I played tennis with Tom
I played with my brother
I pretended to be asleep
I promised no such thing
I read an exciting story
I realized I needed help
I really am very thirsty
I really have missed you
I really should be going
I regret having told you
I relied on his kindness
I roll my own cigarettes
I saw Tom standing there
I slept only three hours
I speak a little Spanish
I spoke to him yesterday
I still have some doubts
I study French at school
I telephoned her at once
I think Tom is dangerous
I think about them often
I think this tastes good
I think you are mistaken
I think you deserve this
I think you dropped this
I think you should leave
I thought I heard voices
I thought I was dreaming
I thought she was pretty
I thought that went well
I thought the same thing
I thought you might come
I thought you might help
I thought you trusted me
I thought you were broke
I thought you were right
I thought you were smart
I thought you would come
I totally agree with you
I tried to warn everyone
I try to please everyone
I usually agree with Tom
I usually walk to school
I visited her in Germany
I waited for ten minutes
I walked across the park
I walked along the river
I walked toward the park
I want some orange juice
I want something to read
I want this room cleaned
I want this suit cleaned
I want to look different
I want to thank everyone
I wanted to surprise Tom
I wanted to surprise her
I was a bit disappointed
I was a little surprised
I was abducted by aliens
I was always the fastest
I was eating dinner then
I was in Tokyo yesterday
I was lonely without her
I was really quite stiff
I was searching for food
I was skeptical at first
I was taken advantage of
I was thinking about you
I went to get vaccinated
I will never forget this
I will never forgive him
I will never forgive you
I will not tolerate this
I wish today were Friday
I wish you every success
I wonder what that means
I wonder where she lives
I wonder who invented it
I would rather stay here
I write almost every day
Include me in your plans
Iron is harder than gold
It appears to be working
It belongs to my brother
It caught me by surprise
It could have been worse
It is cold outside today
It is next to impossible
It is no use complaining
It is not necessarily so
It only works on Windows
It was a beautiful night
It was a terrible affair
It was only a hypothesis
It was probably not true
It was worth every penny
It will not happen again
Japan is in eastern Asia
Keep mum about this plan
Keep these rules in mind
Keep this lesson in mind
Latin is a dead language
Let me check my schedule
Let me check your ticket
Let me explain the rules
Let me get this straight
Let me have another look
Let me introduce my wife
Let me know your address
Let me smell your breath
Let me use your computer
Let us agree to disagree
Look out for rock slides
Lunch will be ready soon
Many friends saw him off
Maybe this was a mistake
Monday is my busiest day
Most of us were veterans
Mother is in the kitchen
Murder is a wicked crime
My birthday is coming up
My brother is a freshman
My car is being repaired
My car is parked outside
My family had many debts
My father has many books
My favorite color is red
My hobby is playing golf
My mother is always busy
My parents are both dead
My parents know about it
My sister is so annoying
My teacher drove me home
My uncle lives in London
My uncles live in London
My university has a dorm
My watch has been stolen
My watch keeps good time
Never be this late again
Never mind what she says
No one says that anymore
No one will believe them
Nobody came to my rescue
Nobody came to the party
Nobody else has a chance
Nobody knows what to say
Nobody wants to be hated
None of them are present
None of them know French
None of this makes sense
Not all blondes are dumb
Not all people like dogs
Not everyone is like you
Of course I remember you
Old people wake up early
One thing led to another
Owls are active at night
Pay at the cash register
People are looking at us
Please be kind to others
Please do not smoke here
Please give me this book
Please make a right turn
Please pass me the sugar
Please put on your shoes
Please refer to page ten
Please say it in English
Please take note of that
Please take off your hat
Please take some of them
Please tell me your name
Please throw me the ball
Please turn on the light
Please turn on the radio
Please turn up the sound
Please wait half an hour
Please wait on him first
Poor men have no leisure
Prices are lower in Kobe
Put yourself in my place
Quit acting like a child
Quit behaving like a kid
Read as much as possible
Rugby is an outdoor game
Say which you would like
She barely ate her lunch
She began to gain weight
She bought him a sweater
She called him bad names
She called off the party
She came home after dark
She decided to marry him
She did not say anything
She dyed her hair blonde
She gives him the creeps
She glanced shyly at him
She goes to night school
She got him into trouble
She grew up in Australia
She had a pleasant dream
She had her tooth pulled
She handed him the money
She handed me a postcard
She has seen better days
She is a reliable person
She is a wonderful woman
She is an appalling cook
She is an obstinate girl
She is brushing her hair
She is everything to him
She is expecting a child
She is just a wallflower
She is known to everyone
She is missing the point
She is not herself today
She is not quite content
She is used to traveling
She kept her eyes closed
She left here right away
She left the baby crying
She left the window open
She lives in the country
She lives in the village
She lives near the beach
She lives quite close by
She lives two doors down
She looks like a teacher
She means nothing to him
She met him this morning
She owns a large mansion
She painted the wall red
She prefers beer to wine
She pulled the door open
She pushed the door open
She pushed the door shut
She sang better than him
She sat there in silence
She shook hands with him
She showed him the photo
She sued him for damages
She thinks highly of him
She took the news calmly
She turned down my offer
She turned her eyes away
She turned off the radio
She was a charming woman
She was accused of lying
She was crying with pain
She was fluent in French
She was voted prom queen
She waved goodbye to him
She will be here tonight
She will become a doctor
She wiped away her tears
She works for a hospital
She writes me every week
Some dogs are very smart
Someone tried to kill me
Someone will do that job
Someone will do this job
Something had to be done
Something has to be done
South Africa is far away
Stay right where you are
Stop acting like a child
Stop by whenever you can
Stop playing hard to get
Stop whining like a baby
Study harder from now on
Take care of your health
Take this to your mother
Thank you for helping me
That could come in handy
That guy drives me crazy
That house belongs to me
That house is very small
That is really good news
That looked like it hurt
That looks like it hurts
That made Tom pretty mad
That may not be possible
That might take too long
That only makes it worse
That seems to make sense
That sounds like a train
That was never an option
That was not my question
The arrow hit the target
The baby cried all night
The ball bounced up high
The bills keep piling up
The blood test is normal
The blood was bright red
The boy adjusted his cap
The boys have gone north
The bus was almost empty
The bus was very crowded
The cat caught the mouse
The climate here is mild
The council agreed on it
The damage has been done
The decision is not easy
The decision was put off
The doctor felt my pulse
The doctor took my pulse
The dog house is outside
The first lesson is easy
The fuel gauge is broken
The girls had a catfight
The house belongs to him
The house has burnt down
The issue is not settled
The lake is deepest here
The law has been changed
The men are eating lunch
The moon is full tonight
The museum is closed now
The nail tore his jacket
The news broke his heart
The news made them happy
The night is still young
The nurses are very nice
The paint is peeling off
The parking lot is empty
The patient has no pulse
The plan has worked well
The police are after you
The poor girl went blind
The rain stopped at last
The rent is due tomorrow
The room has two windows
The server is down again
The show will begin soon
The sky has become clear
The snow melts in spring
The train leaves at nine
The vacation is over now
The war lasted two years
The weather had been hot
The whole crew was saved
The witch hunt has begun
Their cattle are all fat
Their ship struck a rock
There is a knife missing
There is a spoon missing
There is no other choice
There is no school today
There is no third choice
There is nothing to fear
There is plenty of water
These are not your forks
These books are all mine
These books belong to me
These socks do not match
They are afraid of death
They are investing a lot
They are very big apples
They called him a coward
They camped on the beach
They can raise your rent
They caught a lion alive
They could still be here
They did the right thing
They eat fish on Fridays
They found no such proof
They have gone to Europe
They have nothing to eat
They have plenty of time
They live near the beach
They must really hate me
They said you were fired
They stayed up all night
They want to become rich
They want to get married

Twelve is an even number
Vandalism is on the rise
Wait in the waiting room
Walk as fast as possible
Wash your face and hands
We all enjoyed the movie
We almost froze to death
We are moving next month
We are under his command
We are worried about you
We assumed you were dead
We bought bread and milk
We can leave after lunch
We can talk this through
We carried out that plan
We danced all night long
We do very good business
We drove across the city
We felt sympathy for her
We grew closer every day
We had a storm yesterday
We had fun at Disneyland
We had no drinking water
We had snow this morning
We had some chicken soup
We have a little problem

We watched TV last night
We went aboard the plane
We went skiing in Canada

You drive a hard bargain
You have a bright future
You have a gum infection
You have a regular pulse
You have nothing to fear
You look a little shaken
You made a good decision
You may change your mind
You may disagree with me
You must be the Jacksons
You must be very special
You need a reality check
You never arrive on time
You never have any money
You should get some rest
You should go home early
You should have seen him
You should have told him
You should write a novel
You took advantage of me
You were right after all
You will always be there
Your hair will grow back
Your shirt is inside out
Your things are all here
A burnt child dreads fire
A girl appeared before me
A girl stood there crying
A nail punctured the tire
A watched pot never boils
Air is lighter than water
All knowledge is not good
All men are created equal
All men have equal rights
All of them are connected
All the stores are closed
Ants work hard all summer
Any child can answer that
Anyone can ask a question
Anyone can make a mistake
Apples were on sale today
Be kind to little animals
Be polite to your parents
Be prepared for the worst

Here is their photo album
His concert was very good
His father is a physicist
His hair has turned white
His illness may be cancer
His new record sells well
His room was brightly lit
His troubles are not over
His view is quite logical
His work is below average
I accused him of cheating
I admit having done wrong
I admit to being careless
I agree with that opinion
I agree with your opinion
I almost missed the train
I always keep my promises
I am a university student
I am not getting involved
I am watering the flowers
I apologize for the delay
I appreciate how you feel
I appreciate this so much
I arrived there too early
I believe he is competent
I believe in my abilities
I bought a book yesterday
I bought a new television
I brought you some coffee
I called him this morning
I can hardly believe this
I can teach you something
I caught a cold yesterday
I caught them by surprise
I could have you arrested
I could not stop laughing
I enjoy playing the blues
I failed the driving test
I feel bad enough already
I feel more confident now
I figured you should know
I finally gave up smoking
I fixed the car yesterday
I flew to Osaka yesterday
I forget to telephone him
I forgot my email address
I found a nice restaurant
I found the broken camera
I get along with everyone
I got hammered last night
I got my bicycle repaired
I groped for a flashlight
I had a healthy breakfast
I had a premonition today
I had my photograph taken
I hardly slept last night
I hate this job sometimes
I have a Facebook account
I have a business meeting
I have a business partner
I have a couple questions
I have a poor imagination
I have a prior engagement
I have absolutely no clue
I have absolutely no idea
I have almost no appetite
I have an eating disorder

I neither smoke nor drink
I never worried about Tom
I only have one condition
I painted the fence green
I picked you some flowers
I prefer spring to autumn
I prefer to remain seated
I really do appreciate it
I really must finish this
I received a warm welcome
I regret having done that
I remember writing to her
I slept all day yesterday
I slept through the storm
I sometimes dream of home

I was just fooling around
I was just here yesterday
I was just looking around
I was just messing around
I was struck by lightning
I was thinking of leaving
I was very busy yesterday
I was worried for nothing
I watched TV this morning
I watched the whole thing
I will follow your advice
I will stay home tomorrow
I will think of something
I worry about your health
I would advise against it
I would like chicken soup
I would lodge a complaint
It could be a coincidence
It could happen to anyone
It depends on the weather
It has become much warmer
It is a difficult problem
It is still light outside
It is threatening to rain
It is what everybody says
It must be here somewhere
It rained hard last night
It really breaks my heart
It really depends on when
It was a national scandal
It was an uphill struggle
It was just a coincidence
It was just the beginning
It was no laughing matter
It was raining last night
It was sunny this morning
It will cool down tonight
It will soon be September
It will stop raining soon
It works pretty well here
Just ignore what Tom said
Just imitate what he does
Just remember to have fun
Keep focused on your work
Kissing Tom was a mistake
Leaves fall in the autumn
Let me read you something
Let me take your suitcase
Life is full of mysteries
Life is full of surprises
Little remains to be done
Look at all these flowers
Look at that red building
Luna is a reliable person
Many people act like that
Mary is a wedding planner
Mary likes milk very much
Maybe Tom would like that
Maybe we can sit together
Meet me there at midnight
More is not always better
Mother bought me the book
Murder is against the law
My apartment is near here
My battery is almost dead
My brother lives in Tokyo

Nature is full of mystery
Never speak ill of others
Never trust a naked woman
No child should go hungry
No one asked your opinion
No one believed his story
No one could buy anything
No one goes there anymore
No one lives here anymore
No one opposed the choice
No one takes me seriously
No one takes us seriously
No wonder he was arrested
Nobody would listen to me
None of that is necessary
None of us have succeeded
Not all birds build nests
Not even one taxi stopped
Not everybody is the same
Not much time is required
Nothing can save them now
Nothing is left to chance
Nothing is worse than war
One must follow the rules
One plus two equals three
Our hotel faces the coast
Our house faces the beach
Our train arrived on time
Pay attention on the road
People came from all over
Pinocchio had a long nose
Pizza is my favorite food
Please come into the room
Please contact me by mail
Please eat up your dinner
Please fill out this form

Please treat the cat well
Please turn off the light
Please turn off the radio
Press any key to continue
Promise me one more thing
Reading books is my hobby
Remember to lock the door
Remember what Tom told us
Roll up your right sleeve
Say hello to your friends
She always keeps her word
She arrived late as usual
She became a great artist
She bought him some candy
She brushed away the dust
She calls him every night
She could pass for twenty
She denied having met him
She died of typhoid fever
She dropped out of school
She handed him his jacket
She has done her homework
She has known better days
She has never gone abroad
She has never visited him
She has very good manners
She is guilty of stealing
She is knitting a sweater
She is learning the piano
She is no ordinary singer
She is teaching us French
She kept crying all night
She left with her friends
She likes music very much
She lives in an apartment
She looked after her baby
She looked at him angrily
She looked at the picture
She looks like her mother
She lost both her parents
She made her mother happy
She married him last year
She met him for breakfast
She met him only recently
She might know the answer
She often calls him names
She plays the violin well
She pressured him to quit
She promised to marry him
She reminds me of someone
She said something to him
She sleeps on her stomach
She treated him very well
She turned down the radio
She turned off the lights
She usually gets up early
She was a medical student
She was absent from class
She was banished for life
She was crying last night
She was forced to confess
She was humiliated by him
She was ironing her dress
She was there all morning
She wept the entire night
Show me where it happened
Some men shave their legs
Some of the girls laughed
Some of them are teachers
Some of them were wounded
Some people never grow up
Somebody has left his hat
Somebody stole it from me
Somebody tried to kill me
Stay away from that place
Staying at home is boring
Stop acting like you care
Stop screaming in my ears
Suddenly it began to rain
Sugar is soluble in water
Take off your wet clothes
Tell us about your family
Thank you for greeting me
Thank you for not smoking
Thank you for stopping by
Thank you for the present
Thank you for your advice
Thank you for your letter
That almost made me laugh
That blouse fits you well
That may not be necessary
That pasture is ten acres
That pleases me very much
That street is very noisy
That was a costly mistake
That was everything I had
That was painful to watch
That was totally my fault
The Allies wasted no time
The Congress had no money
The alligator ate the dog
The answers are all right
The baby needs his mother
The baby needs its mother
The baby wants its mother
The baby was sound asleep
The bad smell sickened me
The bird spread its wings
The bullet found its mark
The bus is always crowded
The cat is licking itself
The cat scratched my hand
The concert was a success
The cows are eating grass
The crow spread his wings
The default value is zero
The dogs barked all night
The door handle is broken
The elevator is coming up
The event made him famous
The girl entered the room
The girls danced to music
The ground was very rocky
The hotel was burned down
The house has been bought
The hunter caught the fox
The king abused his power
The matter is all settled
The meat is really tender
The meeting was held here
The movie was really good
The opera starts at seven
The organ started to play
The pain is getting worse
The papers got blown away
The park was almost empty
The picnic lasted all day
The plane arrived on time
The price of meat dropped
The rain turned into snow
The reason is very simple
The road turns left there
The slave tried to escape
The soldier gave his name
The store closes at seven
The street lights went on
The street was very empty
The tires are very sticky
The train arrived on time
The tree blocked the road
The water has boiled away
The water is deepest here
The weather is good today
The weather is really bad
The weather report is bad
The whole class was quiet
The woman hugged the baby
The woman is taking notes
The woman washes her face
The workers are on strike
The world has five oceans
The worst is already over
The years pass by quickly
Their daughter is a nurse
There are almost no books
There are no clean plates
There are no comments yet
There are no easy answers
There are no more bullets
There are no tickets left
There are plenty of rocks
There is little time left
There is no running water
There must be another way
There was nothing to burn
These cups are all broken
These shoes are too small
These shoes belong to Tom
These shoes cost too much
They are crazy about jazz
They are reading her book
They are watching a movie
They arrived at the hotel
They felt sure of success
They fought until the end
They found the room empty
They got a warm reception
They had a spat yesterday

Doing that would be stupid
Draw a picture of yourself
Eat whatever food you like
Eat whichever one you like

It has become quite common
It is getting dark outside
It may rain this afternoon
It rained during the night
It seems interesting to me
It was a beautiful wedding
It was a complete disaster
It was a wonderful feeling
It was pitch black outside
It will be cloudy tomorrow
Just tell me what happened
Keep focused on your goals
Learn these names by heart

That affair made him famous
That building is our school

Their names have escaped me
There are five pencils here
These two leaves look alike
They addressed me as doctor
They all burst out laughing

They are reading their book
They concluded he was lying
They died one after another
They drove the adults crazy
They fled in all directions
They found the stolen money
They have a beautiful house
They have nothing in common
They have their own culture
They invited them to dinner
They met each other halfway
They replaced coal with oil
They settled in the country
They study in the afternoon

I want to be at home
I want to buy a book
I want to go to Mars
I want to go to town
I want to rent a car
I want to see a show
I want you to try it
I was born on a ship
I was ready to do it
I was stung by a bee
I will do as you say
I will give it a try
I wish I were a bird
It is no good to you
It means a lot to me
It was all a big lie
My car is out of gas
My pen is out of ink
One of them is a spy
She is in a bad mood
She was hit by a car
Show me how to do it
This is all I can do
This is how I did it
Tom is a Red Sox fan
We are to eat at six
We are two of a kind
You mean a lot to me
You must do as I say
All we can do is hope
All we can do is wait
Do it any way you can
Give him a day or two
He asked me who I was
He came to pick me up
He gave it a new name
He has a lot of money
He has a lot of poise
He has to stay in bed
He hit me in the face
He hit me on the head
He hung on to his job
He is a man of reason
He is a man of vision
He is a man of wealth
He is a man of wisdom
He is as good as dead
He is not kind to her
He is not what he was
He is said to be rich
He is such a show off
He is unable to do it
He is very mean to me
He let go of the rope
He made me a new suit
He may be sick in bed
He must be a good boy
He owns a lot of land
He proved to be a spy
He sat in front of me
He took us to the zoo
He used to read a lot
I am glad to help you
I am no match for him
I am too tired to run
I bet he will get mad
I can ask Tom to help
I can do this all day
I can prove it to you
I did try to warn you
I did what I was told
I feed meat to my dog
I feel like a new man
I felt a drop of rain
I go to bed about ten
I go to school by bus
I got out of the taxi
I got soap in my eyes
I got what I came for
I had a bad day today
I had a race with him
I had to go back home
I had to leave my job
I handed a map to him
I hate the way I look
I have a favor to ask
I have a lot of books
I have a lot of money
I have a lot to learn
I have no money on me
I have so much to say
I have to do it again
I have to feed my cat
I have to go to sleep
I hit him on the chin
I hope I see it again
I just hope Tom is OK
I know a lot about it
I know what we can do
I know why you did it
I know you can see it
I lost a lot of blood
I lost a lot of money
I love you like a son
I made a lot of money
I made a mess of that
I may need to move on
I meant to look it up
I met her an hour ago
I need to get a stamp
I need to go to sleep
I need to pay my rent
I need to see Tom now
I need to talk to him
I need to warn my mom
I need you in my life
I need you on my side
I need you to go home
I put it in your room
I put it on your desk
I ran away in a hurry
I ride a bike to work
I saw Tom in the park
I saw him in the park
I told her what to do
I told him what to do
I told you to call me
I used to be like you
I used to be your age
I used to not do that
I want a book to read
I want a piece of pie
I want to be an actor
I want to be with Tom
I want to be with you
I want to do it right
I want to eat a steak
I want to go home now
I want to go to Tokyo
I want to go with you
I want to sing a song
I want to take a walk
I want you to be here
I want you to be safe
I want you to do this
I want you to drop it
I want you to go back
I want you to go home
I want you to grow up
I want you to kiss me
I want you to want me
I was forced to do it
I was not a bit tired
I watch TV off and on
I will get it for you
I will give it to you
I will go if you come
I wish I had a camera
I wish I had seen her
I wish I had your job
I wish I were a stone
I wish to be a doctor
It is a very sad tale
It is good to see you
It is too hot to work
It is too late for me
It is true in a sense
It is what I would do
It may not be a dream
Let me give you a hug
My car ran out of gas
My house is on a hill
No one here has a car
No one is in the room
No one knew who I was
No one was in the car
She and I get on well
She got him a new hat
She got me a tiny toy
She is as tall as you
She put it in the box
She went in to get it
Tell me how he got it
That was a lot of fun
The cat is in the box
The sun is in the sky
This is how I made it
Tom is a very shy boy
Tom is as old as Mary
Tom is too old for me
We all got in the car
We gave it to the man
We have a lot of time
We just have to do it
We live in a big city
We lost a lot of time
We saw it on the news
What I need is a beer
You know I have to go
A fox is a wild animal
All I want is your cat
Allow us to do our job
Buy a book and read it
Do one thing at a time
Do what you have to do
Even a child can do it
Get me a glass of milk
Get me out of here now
God has a plan for you
He asked a favor of me
He came when I was out
He did it just for fun
He does not wear a hat
He found me a good job
He found me a nice tie
He gave me a ride home
He gave the dog a bone
He had a new suit made
He has a grip of steel
He has a heart of gold
He has come a long way
He is a man of ability
He is a very smart boy
He is blind in one eye
He is equal to the job
He is in love with her
He is in need of money
He is quite an odd man
He is thick as a brick
He is used to the work
He lay down on the bed
He made a lot of money
He may have told a lie
He runs as fast as you
He said he could do it
He said that I must go
He sat down by my side
He told me where to go
He took me by the hand
He used a lot of honey
He wanted to go to sea
He was in the hot seat
He was scared to do it
He was sick of his job
He was too old to swim
He went in place of me
He went off in a hurry
He will end up in jail
I always get up at six
I am happy to meet you
I am no longer a child
I am not proud of this
I am ready to help you
I am taking a bath now
I asked a favor of him
I asked her for a date
I asked him to do that
I ate lunch in a hurry
I bared my soul to her
I begged her not to go
I bought Tom a hot dog
I bought a dog for him
I bought her a new car
I can come if you want
I can do it all myself
I change my mind a lot
I chose him a nice tie
I could see it was you
I dare say he is right
I decided to buy a car
I did it all by myself
I did not see the sign
I did what I was asked
I do that all the time
I do this for a living
I eat a lot of carrots
I feel a lot safer now
I feel a sense of duty
I feel like I know you
I felt like I was dead
I gave Tom my car keys
I gave him a few books
I gave it my best shot
I go to bed very early
I go to school on foot
I got dealt a bad hand
I got lost in the snow
I got on the wrong bus
I got what I asked for
I grew up near a river
I had a very good time
I had a very nice time
I had him fix my watch
I had him wash the car
I had my hat blown off
I had to do this today
I had to get back home
I had to get some help
I had to go to America
I had to see you again
I have a bad pain here
I have a lot of dreams
I have a right to know
I have to comb my hair
I have to do it myself
I have to get up early
I have to open my shop
I have to take an exam
I hit him in the belly
I hope it was worth it
I hope to see it again
I hope to see you soon
I just got a new phone
I just got out of jail
I just had a bad dream
I just want to be sure
I just want to go home
I knew you could do it
I know each one of you
I know how old you are
I know how they did it
I know what not to eat
I know who my enemy is
I know who that is now
I know you can make it
I left it on the table
I left my card at home
I like being on my own
I like that it is soft
I like you as a friend
I live in a rural area
I lost a bunch of keys
I lost my trust in him
I made my dog lie down
I meet him at the club
I met him in the crowd
I need a few more days
I need a new USB cable
I need to end this now
I need to find Tom now
I need to go into town
I need you to fix this
I need you to see this
I only have one so far
I quit a long time ago
I ran all the way home
I ran out of the house
I read a lot of novels
I read it to my family
I really do have to go
I ride my bike to work
I run five miles a day
I sat down next to him
I saw Tom a minute ago
I saw a flock of sheep
I saw a light far away
I saw a woman in black
I saw fear in his eyes
I saw him wash the car
I see how you did that
I seem to have a fever
I sent an email to you
I think God is a woman
I think I broke my leg
I think I can fix this
I think I can help Tom
I think I can prove it
I think I have an idea
I think I lost my keys
I think Tom has a plan
I think Tom is in love
I think he is a doctor
I think we can do that
I think you lied to me
I thought I got it all
I told Tom I loved him
I told Tom not to come
I took a trip to Tokyo
I used to keep a diary
I want a piece of cake
I want a quart of milk
I want a word with you
I want this to be over
I want to be a teacher
I want to be an artist
I want to buy them all
I want to check it out
I want to cook for you
I want to do it myself
I want to go into town
I want to go right now
I want to go to Sweden
I want to hear who won
I want to ride a horse
I want to write a book
I want to write to Tom
I want you out of here
I want you to be quiet
I want you to find out
I want you to see this
I wanted to rent a bus
I was able to help her
I was happy to see him
I was no match for him
I was the last to know
I was there a year ago
I will do it right now
I will not do it again
I will wait for a week
I wish I could see you
I would like to see it
I wrote him to ask why
It is me that is wrong
It is time I left here
It was a very big room
It was a waste of time
It was as hard as rock
It was hot in the room
It was such a nice day
Let me buy you a drink
Let me do this for you
Let me get back to you
Let me get you the key
Make the new guy do it
Meet me in the hot tub
My dog has a long tail
My life is such a mess
My mother is on a diet
New York is a big city
Nice of you to drop by
No one can go in there
No one knew what to do
No one knew who did it
No one was in the park
No one was in the room
Our TV is out of order
Run as fast as you can
She had a crush on him
She is as poor as ever
She is fit for the job
She is in need of help
She is no match for me
She is very kind to us
She is wiser than I am
She put in for a raise
She woke up on her own
Show me how to do that
Show me how to do this
Talk to me if you want
Teach me how you do it
Tell me how you did it
The boy sat on a chair
The cat is in the well
The cat is on the roof
The cat sat on the mat
This is why I hate him
Tom had a blue coat on
Tom had to make a fire
Tom has a lot of money
Tom is as tall as Mary
Tom is older than I am
Tom is very kind to us
Tom is wiser than I am
Tom says he has a plan
Try as hard as you can
Try not to be so tense
Wait for me in the car
We all had a good time
We all have jobs to do
We all want to go home
We are on the way home
We are to meet at noon
We can be a lot better
We can do a lot better
We can do it right now
We can do so much more
We did all we could do
We gave the car a push
We go to school by bus
We got lost in the fog
We had a very busy day
We have run out of gas
We have to do our best
We met on a blind date
We plan to stay a week
We want to be the best
We want to have a baby
We want to talk to Tom
We want to talk to you
We want you to take it
We waste a lot of time
We were all on the bus
You are free to go out
You are right in a way
You can go back to bed
You may or may not win
You may use my new car
You must do it at once
You must go to bed now
Your bag is on my desk
A bear can climb a tree
A good idea came to him
A lot of people do that
A lot of people do this
A pony is a small horse
All I want is your love
All of the cake is gone
All of us know him well
All of us stared at her
Come on in and sit down
Get it out of the house
Give me a cup of coffee
Give me a glass of milk
Go and get me some milk
Go and get me some wine
Go get a drink of water
He asked us to help him
He ate all of the apple
He came here to help me
He came out of the room
He can swim like a fish
He caught me by the arm
He did it for the money
He did it in good faith
He did not get up early
He did not sleep a wink
He did not speak at all
He did what he was told
He earns a lot of money
He gave me a stern look
He gave the child a toy
He got lost in the city
He had a blue jacket on
He had to carry the bag
He has a lot of hobbies
He has a sense of humor
He has a test next week
He has bought a new car
He has no eye for women
He is a highly paid man
He is a sort of painter
He is at home in France
He is doing a super job
He is eager to go there
He is equal to the task
He is full of new ideas
He is looking for a job
He is lying on the sofa
He is no friend of mine
He is no longer a child
He is not honest at all
He is not like he seems
He is not wearing a hat
He is not what he seems
He is on board the ship
He is out of the office
He is said to have died
He is still on his back
He is strong as a horse
He lives in a big house
He lives in a port town
He looked me in the eye
He looked up at the sky
He made a joke about it
He met a nice young man
He put air in his tires
He runs a lot of hotels
He saved a lot of money
He saw a light far away
He seems to be rich now
He took her by the hand
He used to get up early
He wanted to buy a book
He wants to talk to you
He was knee deep in mud
He was lying on the bed
He was more than a king
He went out in the rain
He went out of the room
His life is in my hands
His name is known to me
I am loved by my mother
I am too tired to climb
I am very happy with it
I asked him to make tea
I ate a salad for lunch
I believe it to be true
I came back to help you
I came to give you this
I can do this all night
I can make this go away
I care about all of you
I caught him by the arm
I caught him in the act
I could do that for you
I could do this all day
I do not like the house
I do not like this song
I do not need money now
I do not want any money
I doubt if he is honest
I doubt if he will come
I eat here all the time
I expect him to help me
I feel a lot better now
I feel bad for that guy
I feel like I could cry
I feel like such a fool
I fell in love with her
I fell in love with you
I felt like I would die
I found a place to live
I found it in the attic
I gave my sister a doll
I go to school with him
I go to work by bicycle
I got a letter from her
I got lost in the woods
I got my hair cut today
I got up early as usual
I grew up in this house
I had a dream about him
I had a great time here
I had a promise to keep
I had a very high fever
I had some things to do
I had to get some money
I had to keep my secret
I had to look after you
I had to work on Sunday
I hate math most of all
I hate to be a nuisance
I hate to waste my time
I have a bath every day
I have a lot of friends
I have a place to sleep
I have a very old stamp
I have bad news for you
I have come to kill you
I have no beef with him
I have no books to read
I have no choice at all
I have no desire to try
I have no proof of that
I have the ace of clubs
I have to clean my room
I have to clean that up
I have to do this alone
I have to iron my shirt
I have to take a shower
I heard her sing a song
I hope this is worth it
I hope to hear from you
I hope to pass my exams
I hope to see you again
I hope you are all well
I just got back in town
I just need to be alone
I just want to be alone
I just want to be clear
I just want to be loved
I just want to have fun
I just want to help you
I just want to know why
I just want you to come
I knew we would find it
I know I made a mistake
I know Tom and his wife
I know how busy you are
I know that he can draw
I know that she is cute
I know when to say when
I know you want to help
I learned to milk a cow
I left my watch at home
I lent my pencil to Tom
I like it more and more
I like my job just fine
I like the way you look
I like the way you sing
I like the way you talk
I like the way you walk
I like to clean my room
I like you a great deal
I live here with my dog
I live just up the road
I lost my job on Monday
I lost my way in Boston
I love the way you kiss
I love the way you talk
I love the way you walk
I love to see you laugh
I love to see you smile
I made a fool of myself
I may swim in the river
I need to be left alone
I need to get a haircut
I need to take a shower
I need to talk with you
I need to wash my hands
I need you to leave now
I needed Tom to do that
I needed to talk to you
I never told you to lie
I no longer need a loan
I only want to help you
I owe my success to him
I owe my success to you
I owe you a big apology
I read it in a magazine
I read one of his works
I really have to go now
I really like you a lot
I really miss you a lot
I said I would help you
I said it was all right
I saw him looking at me
I saw him sawing a tree
I saw tears in her eyes
I saw tears in his eyes
I saw the cake you made
I saw what your dog did
I sent a message to Tom
I share a room with Tom
I showed my room to Tom
I showed my room to him
I take a bath every day
I take back what I said
I think I can do better
I think I have a cavity
I think Tom can do that
I think Tom is a coward
I think Tom may be dead
I think Tom may be hurt
I think Tom may be sick
I think Tom needs to go
I think about her a lot
I think we need to talk
I think we were lied to
I thought I saw a ghost
I thought I was on time
I thought it was a joke
I thought we had a deal
I told Tom to ignore it
I took a picture of her
I tried to cheer him up
I use this all the time
I usually get up at six
I want Tom to come back
I want Tom to read this
I want a piece of candy
I want this to be yours
I want to be a magician
I want to be left alone
I want to buy ski boots
I want to check out now
I want to do it tonight
I want to do this alone
I want to do this later
I want to do this right
I want to focus on that
I want to get this done
I want to go to Seattle
I want to go to college
I want to hear from you
I want to live in Italy
I want to live in Tampa
I want to look like her
I want to make it right
I want to read the book
I want to see a volcano
I want to see the world
I want to see you first
I want to see you laugh
I want to see you smile
I want to see your boss
I want to stay with you
I want to take it apart
I want to talk with you
I want to wash up first
I want to work with you
I want you to come back
I want you to handle it
I want you to have this
I wanted Tom to help me
I wanted to ask Tom why
I wanted to go to China
I wanted to read a book
I was chosen to do that
I was happy to help you
I was lost in the crowd
I was really mad at Tom
I was shocked to see it
I was young at the time
I watch TV now and then
I went stag to the prom
I went to Kobe by train
I will not let you pass
I wish I could help you
I wish I had eaten more
I wish he were here now
I wish to see my father
I wish we could do that
I wish we had done more
I wish you two the best
I wonder if he likes me
I wonder if he loves me
I work in a flower shop
I would like to do more
I would like to eat now
It happens to all of us
It is dark in that room
It is fun to play cards
It is likely to be fine
It keeps me up at night
It may be our only hope
It may be the last time
It may rain at any time
It was Tom who did that
It was a fine sunny day
It was dark in the room
It was her that told me
It was her turn at last
It was not at all funny
It was out of his reach
Jump as high as you can
Just tell me what to do
Kick as hard as you can
Leave the room as it is
Let me get that for you
Let me get you some ice
Let me know how it goes
Let me take my coat off
My bike has a flat tire
My house is up the road
My mother made me a bag
My uncle came to see me
My uncle gave me a book
My wife just had a baby
Nara is as old as Kyoto
New York is a huge city
No one knows what to do
No one ran ahead of him
Please let go of my arm
She came here to see me
She cut the cake in two
She drank a cup of milk
She forced him to do it
She gave me a shy smile
She gave us lots to eat
She got wet to the skin
She is a friend of mine
She is a stranger to me
She is a very kind girl
She is in a green dress
She is in an awful mood
She is in her hotel now
She is in love with him
She is proud of her son
She made a bet with him
She made him a new coat
She made him a new suit
She must be forty or so
She told me where to go
She took him to the zoo
She took me by the hand
She was about to go out
She was in a silk dress
Show him how to do this
Take a book and read it
Take a look at this map
Tell me what to do here
That may not be so easy
That would not be a lie
The TV was on all night
The baby is one day old
The best is yet to come
The box has holes in it
The box is made of wood
The car cut to the left
The car ran into a tree
The cat is on the table
The cat ran up the tree
The dog is on the chair
The key is on the table
The pen is on the table
The radio is a bit loud
The sheet is on the bed
The sun is about to set
The trees were in a row
There is a lot of money
There was a lot of wind
They go to work on foot
This is a kind of bread
This is a very good tea
This is by far the best
This is how I cook fish
This is not a good sign
This is not good at all
This time I will try it
This used to be my room
Tom and I keep in touch
Tom and I will help you
Tom asked me to be here
Tom ate more than I did
Tom got back in the car
Tom got up to help Mary
Tom had to do some work
Tom has come to see you
Tom is a friend of mine
Tom is a very good cook
Tom is drunk as a skunk
Tom is in an angry mood
Tom is in the ski lodge
Tom is lying ill in bed
Tom is not fond of pets
Tom is proud of his car
Tom is proud of his son
Tom ran out of the room
Tom seems to be in love
Tom told me I was wrong
Tom told me you hit him
Tom was bitten by a dog
Tom was shot in the leg
Tom will do a great job
We all had a great time
We all stood up at once
We are a family of five
We are a family of four
We are glad to help you
We do this all the time
We gave him up for dead
We had a real good time
We have come a long way
We have to wait for him
We know how to find Tom
We made it out of there
We put sugar in our tea
We saw Tom on the beach
We should be on our way
We used to live in Kobe
We wasted a lot of time
We went as far as Kyoto
What I need is a friend
What Tom said was a lie
You are free to go home
You are in a safe place
You are to come with me
You are very dear to me
You have a lot of books
You have a lot of nerve
You have to do it again
You have to do it today
You make me laugh a lot
You must be a good cook
You must go up the hill
You must not tell a lie
You need a lot of water
You need to hit the gym
You or I will be chosen
You should go on a diet
You were all a big help
A ball hit her right leg
A lot of time was wasted
All I think about is you
All of them are not poor
All of us play the piano
All of you did good work
All that he says is true
All the other kids do it
Any clever boy can do it
Asians eat a lot of rice
Ask her what her name is
Ask your dad to help you
Call me if you need help
Come on any day you like
Correct me if I am wrong
Do it when you have time
Do what you want with it
Each of them sang a song
Either come in or go out
Either you or I am right
Either you or I am wrong
Fake it till you make it
Get off at the next stop
Get that thing off of me
Get them out of my sight
Give me a bottle of wine
Give me a glass of water
Give me a hand with this
Give me a piece of chalk
Give me a piece of paper
Give the money to my son
Go and see him in person
Good luck to both of you
Grab as much as you need
He acts like a rock star
He asked for a pay raise
He assigned me a new job
He came down with a cold
He caught her by the arm
He caught me by the hand
He caught me by the neck
He cut the apple in half
He did a pretty good job
He did it for his family
He did not die of cancer
He did the best he could
He died a few days later
He does not get up early
He drank a cup of coffee
He drew a chair near her
He fell and hurt his leg
He fell in love with her
He fired most of his men
He found me a good place
He gave a sigh of relief
He gave me all his money
He gave me what I needed
He had his share of luck
He had to clean his room
He has a very good voice
He has ants in his pants
He has lots of new ideas
He invited me to a party
He is a man of character
He is a pretty great guy
He is after a better job
He is armed to the teeth
He is busy with his work
He is by no means bright
He is employed in a bank
He is not at all foolish
He is such a lazy fellow
He is very fond of music
He knows a lot of people
He led us to the station
He let me leave the room
He leveled his gun at me
He lifted her in the air
He likes to talk of love
He lives next door to us
He looked me in the face
He looks old for his age
He lost all of his money
He made a will last year
He made fun of my accent
He may have lost his way
He must be an honest man
He nudged me to go ahead
He owns a good few sheep
He picked up a red stone
He put on the black coat
He put on the red jacket
He runs well for his age
He saw that he was wrong
He set his house on fire
He showed a lot of skill
He spoke well of her son
He stole a kiss from her
He taught me how to swim
He told me where to shop
He told us to keep quiet
He took a taxi both ways
He took part in the race
He treats me as an adult
He used to read at night
He walked in front of me
He wanted to be a farmer
He wants to see us again
He was alone in the room
He was every inch a king
He was given up for dead
He was happy being a Jew
He was killed in the war
He was lying on his back
He was sworn in as mayor
He was the last to leave
He was very busy all day
He went to Boston by car
He will come in a moment
He will not listen to me
He will soon be a father
He wore a light blue tie
He worked for a rich man
He would let me help him
He writes me once a week
Heat is a form of energy
Her car is two years old
Here is a letter for you
His car is gaining on us
His car is two years old
I admit that I was wrong
I admit that he is right
I already gave it to Tom
I am about to leave here
I am afraid he will fail
I am content with my job
I am going to that place
I am just warming up now
I am loved by my parents
I am not romantic at all
I am only warming up now
I am quite all right now
I am ready to follow you
I am sure of her success
I am sure of his honesty
I am sure of his success
I am tired of hearing it
I am very poor at sports
I am willing to help you
I asked Tom for his keys
I beg to differ with you
I bought a pair of boots
I bought a pair of shoes
I came to talk about Tom
I can barely pay my rent
I can sing it in English
I caught her by the hand
I caught them in the act
I could keep it a secret
I cut down a cherry tree
I did it against my will
I do not like him either
I feel better than I did
I felt sorry for the boy
I gave in to her demands
I go to a driving school
I go to church every day
I go to church on Sunday
I go to school every day
I got her to wash dishes
I got lost in the forest
I got on the wrong train
I got what you asked for
I grew up in the country
I had a cat named Cookie
I had a checklist I used
I had a dog named Cookie
I had a stroke last year
I had nowhere else to go
I had some time to think
I had to change the plan
I had to face this alone
I had to make a decision
I had two cups of coffee
I handed the mike to him
I hate the guy next door
I hate this part of town
I hate to argue with you
I have a lot of homework
I have a sharp pain here
I have a thesis to write
I have drunk all my milk
I have good news for you
I have many things to do
I have no doubt about it
I have no memory of that
I have no time for games
I have some news for you
I have to brush my teeth
I have to come on Monday
I have to cover his loss
I have to do my homework
I have to get some sleep
I have to help my mother
I hear voices in my head
I hope she will get well
I hope that you are good
I hope you two are happy
I invited her to a movie
I just need to stay calm
I just want my life back
I just want to be normal
I just want to thank you
I keep a diary every day
I kiss with my eyes open
I know both of the girls
I know exactly who it is
I know that you are busy
I know that you love Tom
I know the poem by heart
I know what to watch for
I know what your name is
I know who you were with
I know you did your best
I learned a lot from Tom
I learned a lot from you
I left a message for Tom
I like being my own boss
I like being on the team
I like my life right now
I like that tie of yours
I like the sound of that
I like the way you smile
I like the way you think
I like to dress this way
I like to play the piano
I like to ride on trains
I like to try new things
I looked down at the sea
I looked him in the eyes
I lost my wife last year
I lost track of the time
I love the way you laugh
I love the way you think
I love this time of year
I made a lot of mistakes
I made him open the door
I met Tom at the library
I met him at the station
I met him by pure chance
I met him the day before
I must decide what to do
I need to get some sleep
I need to sleep a little
I need you to believe me
I never did get it right
I never saw him in jeans
I never saw such a woman
I never told you to quit
I often go to the movies
I often lie about my age
I only have eyes for you
I only need two of these
I paid to have this done
I plan to go there alone
I put cream in my coffee
I ran into an old friend
I really did learn a lot
I really had a good time
I really want to see you
I regret that I told you
I rushed out of my house
I saw Tom in the hallway
I saw Tom take your keys
I saw a whale tail today
I saw her clean the room
I saw her play the piano
I saw him cross the road
I saw him enter the room
I saw it from the window
I saw the movie on video
I see tears in your eyes
I see what you did there
I slept lying on my face
I stayed at a nice hotel
I stayed home for a week
I taught him how to swim
I think Tom is a student
I think my leg is broken
I think that he is right
I think this one is good
I think we can do better
I think we can go faster
I think we can handle it
I think we can relax now
I think we can trust Tom
I think we need a doctor
I think we need more ice
I think we should go now
I think you should do it
I think you went too far
I thought about it a lot
I thought it was a fluke
I thought we could do it
I told Tom about my past
I told you it would work
I took care of it myself
I usually wake up at six
I want my money back now
I want to find true love
I want to go out tonight
I want to hold your hand
I want to join your team
I want to know about you
I want to make her happy
I want to make you happy
I want to make you smile
I want to read this book
I want to see for myself
I want to see them again
I want to see your house
I want to test my limits
I want to think about it
I want to write a letter
I want you all to myself
I wanted him to go there
I was asked to wait here
I was at a movie theater
I was caught in a shower
I was frozen to the bone
I was just going to work
I was just in the shower
I was late for the train
I was moved by his tears
I was on the wrong track
I was on time for dinner
I was scratched by a cat
I was trying to find Tom
I was unable to save Tom
I was ushered to my seat
I was waiting for a taxi
I wash my hair every day
I went there to meet him
I went to see my parents
I will be busy next week
I will be sixteen in May
I will call on you again
I will come by all means
I will explain it to her
I will explain it to him
I will go to the meeting
I will have to help them
I will never do it again
I will write to you soon
I wish I had married her
I wish it were that easy
I wish this was all over
I wish you all good luck
I wonder if Tom can come
I wonder if he will come
I wonder if this is love
I wonder where he is now
I wonder why he did that
I would like to kiss you
I would like to meet you
I wrote to you from Iraq
It feels good to be back
It gave me quite a shock
It is going to rain soon
It is none the less true
It is not a real mansion
It is really nice of you
It is wrong to tell lies
It makes no sense at all
It seems that he is rich
It sounds like a fun job
It takes one to know one
It turned out to be true
It was all a big mistake
It was an act of courage
It was just as I thought
Just give me what I want
Just take my word for it
Keep an eye on the girls
Leave your desk as it is
Let me open it by myself
Let me tell you a secret
Look what I made for Tom
Maybe we can make a deal
Meet me at the hotel bar
Music is a gift from God
My aunt gave me a camera
My aunt gave me an album
My boys are all grown up
My career is on the line
My family is a large one
My fate is in your hands
My father gave me a game
My father is in his room
My husband is a good man
My life is in your hands
My mother is sick in bed
My printer is low on ink
My son has a black beard
My son is taller than me
My uncle gave me his car
My wife is a poor driver
No one can figure it out
No one has ever seen God
No one knows what to say
No one wants to go there
Not all of them are busy
Now this is more like it
One of the dogs is alive
Our class is a small one
Our dog is in the kennel
Our work is all over now
Owls can see in the dark
Put the book on the desk
Put the gun on the table
Say what you have to say
She asked me where to go
She caught me by the arm
She cut the apple in two
She found me a good seat
She gave a cat some milk
She gave him a big smile
She had a new dress made
She had a strange hat on
She has had to stay here
She is a child after all
She is all skin and bone
She is at work right now
She is deaf to my advice
She is hard up for money
She is no stranger to me
She is not afraid to die
She is not very well off
She is one of my friends
She knows what to do now
She looked me in the eye
She looked up at the sky
She made me a nice dress
She made the doll for me
She met him on the beach
She must have told a lie
She ordered a cup of tea
She ordered him to do it
She read one poem to him
She seems to be very ill
She told me she loved me
She took a trip to Paris
She took him to the lake
She tried on a new dress
She wants to read a book
She was eager to go home
She was equal to the job
She was late for the bus
She was very rude to him
She waved her hand to me
She waved her hand to us
She will be back at five
She will be there by now
Shut up and let me think
Stop being so nice to me
Study as hard as you can
Take as long as you need
Take as many as you want
Take as much as you like
Take as much as you want
Tell her that I love her
Tell me what I did wrong
Ten years is a long time
That car has a roof rack
That cost a lot of money
That is all that he said
That might not be so bad
That toy is made of wood
That was all Greek to me
That was only a year ago
The area is built up now
The baby is able to walk
The boat sank in a flash
The book is on the table
The book is out of print
The boy fell off the bed
The bus stop is close by
The car has a new engine
The cat is in its basket
The cat sat on the table
The desk is made of wood
The dog seems to be sick
The food is on the table
The girl let the bird go
The gown is made of silk
The house is on the hill
The plural of ox is oxen
The rent is far too high
The sky is full of stars
The sun sets in the west
The tip of the key broke
The train got in on time
The two of them split up
The worst is yet to come
They are all alike to me
They are as strong as us
They ate up all the cake
They did not clap for us
They met on a blind date
They say he is very rich
They sent me to kill you
They set out on a picnic
They set to work at once
They were seen to go out
This has to be a mistake
This is a friend of mine
This is a very tall tree
This is as heavy as lead
This is going to be easy
This is not what we want
This is such a sad story
This is the worst of all
This is what you must do
This is where I was born
This old coat has had it
This one is a lot easier
This was a gift from Tom
This was meant as a joke
This will be on the test
This will do for a chair
Tokyo is a very big city
Tom asked us to sit down
Tom came here to help me
Tom can sleep in my room
Tom died a few years ago
Tom has a lot of enemies
Tom has a son named John
Tom has a very large ego
Tom is a really cool guy
Tom is hard up for money
Tom is looking for a job
Tom is making me do this
Tom is on the honor roll
Tom is proud of his sons
Tom is taking care of me
Tom knows a lot of songs
Tom left his dog at home
Tom must be proud of you
Tom needs to do that now
Tom ran all the way home
Tom said he wants to die
Tom said he would buy it
Tom sat down on the sofa
Tom says a lot of things
Tom sold his car to Mary
Tom told Mary to shut up
Tom told me to wait here
Tom used to be a soldier
Tom used to love his job
Tom wants me to help him
Tom wants to go with you
Tom wants to sleep on it
Tom wants to talk to you
Tom was going to help us
Tom was having a bad day
Tom was shot in the head
We all had the same idea
We all have our off days
We are all happy to help
We are going to the shop
We are not all that safe
We are sold out of jeans
We ate at the food court
We bought a pound of tea
We did what we were told
We eat soup with a spoon
We expect a lot from him
We go to school to learn
We go to the same school
We have no more in stock
We have run out of sugar
We have to do that today
We have to make a choice
We have to start at once
We hope to see you again
We just want to be happy
We just want to have fun
We leave in half an hour
We live in a remote area
We lost all of our money
We need to do this right
We now come to the point
We slept in the same bed
We take a bath every day
We tried to cheer him up
We want to talk with Tom
We went there for a week
We went to Boston by bus
We were all so busy then
What he said is not true
You and I made a bargain
You are my pride and joy
You are not at all wrong
You can ask Tom for help
You can come at any time
You can eat all you want
You can only use it once
You can stay at my place
You can stay if you like
You can wait for me here
You could be one of them
You get what you pay for
You have my word on that
You have to come with me
You have to wait in line
You made me lose my mind
You may come if you like
You may go if you choose
You may still be in luck
You must not stay in bed
You need a change of air
You need to take a break
You ought not to miss it
You should try to see it
You were kind to help me
Your book is on the desk
A button came off my coat
A decision had to be made
A fork fell off the table
A gun might come in handy
A horse can run very fast
A man began to follow Tom
A policeman came up to me
A rat ran across the road
A tear ran down her cheek
Air is a mixture of gases
All of my things are gone
Be quiet and listen to me
Both of us are from Tampa
Bring me a glass of water
Bring me a piece of chalk
Bring the water to a boil
Come and have tea with me
Come and see me right now
Come at any time you like
Cut the cake with a knife
Do a better job next time
Get that dog away from me
Give that book back to me
Go and sit by your father
God knows that it is true
Grab the end of this rope
He advised me to go there
He asked me what I needed
He began to look for work
He bought a dress for her
He can run faster than me
He caught hold of my hand
He cut down a cherry tree
He did it out of kindness
He did it with great zeal
He did not like to travel
He died of a heart attack
He does it faster than me
He does this all the time
He donated a lot of money
He drank a bottle of wine
He failed to come on time
He fell down on the floor
He fell into a deep sleep
He forced her to sit down
He gave me a vague answer
He goes to school on foot
He has all kinds of books
He helped me fix my watch
He hit on a splendid idea
He is a danger to society
He is a little over forty
He is a novelist and poet
He is capable of doing it
He is either drunk or mad
He is inclined to be lazy
He is inclined to get mad
He is more clever than me
He is nothing but a child
He is old enough to drink
He is one of my neighbors
He is playing in his room
He is very afraid of dogs
He is very friendly to us
He just wants to have fun
He keeps his age a secret
He likes his school a lot
He likes to live in Tokyo
He lives in a large house
He lives in the next town
He looked like a rich man
He looks good for his age
He lost sight of the bird
He must be from the South
He ordered me to go alone
He ordered me to stand up
He promised not to say it
He put milk in his coffee
He ran the fastest of all
He rang me up at midnight
He sat next to the stream
He seems to have been ill
He seldom comes to see me
He showed off his new car
He sold all that he owned
He studied to be a doctor
He swims better than I do
He taught me how to drive
He tends to talk too much
He thinks he can prove it
He thought of a good idea
He treats me like a child
He tried it with a friend
He tried to open the door
He walked at a quick pace
He wanted to buy the book
He wanted to come with us
He wants to go to America
He wants to learn to swim
He wants you to come home
He was afraid of his wife
He was afraid of the dark
He was alone in the house
He was blue from the cold
He was looking at the sky
He was lying on the couch
He was lying on the grass
He was more or less drunk
He was not a good speaker
He was not happy about it
He was regarded as a hero
He was sitting next to me
He was too angry to speak
He was too tired to study
He was wounded in the war
He went back to the store
He will be a good husband
He will be a good teacher
He will make you eat dirt
He will not agree with us
He will not do it anymore
He works as a gym teacher
He works in a call center
He wrote a lot of stories
He wrote me a love letter
Help me for just a minute
His career is on the line
His house is easy to find
His smile put her at ease
His story may not be true
I already know who did it
I already took care of it
I am acting for my father
I am delighted to be here
I am feeling sad about it
I am forever in your debt
I am going to be fourteen
I am going to get dressed
I am hanging up my shirts
I am living with my uncle
I am not a morning person
I am not on call tomorrow
I am on holiday this week
I am sorry to trouble you
I am talking to my sister
I am through with my work
I am used to living alone
I am using a new computer
I am very busy these days
I apologize to all of you
I ate too much last night
I awoke from a long dream
I believe I can trust you
I believe Tom can do that
I bought a pair of gloves
I bought this TV from Tom
I can deliver that to Tom
I can do better than this
I can do without his help
I cut myself with a knife
I did all the work myself
I did it out of curiosity
I did just like you asked
I did nothing of the sort
I did think Tom might win
I disposed of my old coat
I do anything I feel like
I do not love him anymore
I enjoy it more each time
I feel a lot better today
I feel like such an idiot
I feel like taking a rest
I feel like taking a walk
I feel so alive right now
I feel tired all the time
I feel very sorry for him
I fell when I was running
I felt like such an idiot
I find it hard to believe
I flunked two of my tests
I forgot it in the garage
I forgot to ask your name
I forgot to bring the map
I forgot to lock the door
I found out where she was
I go swimming once a week
I go to school by bicycle
I got the ticket for free
I got there ahead of time
I got tired with the work
I guess I should be going
I had a good time tonight
I had him repair my watch
I had my doubts about you
I had to change the rules
I had to refuse her offer
I hate this kind of place
I have a decision to make
I have a delivery for you
I have a delivery to make
I have a few friends here
I have a little money now
I have a lot of neighbors
I have a lot of questions
I have a much better idea
I have a schedule to keep
I have a solution in mind
I have a very good memory
I have an apology to make
I have at least ten books
I have been to Kyoto once
I have bigger fish to fry
I have feeling in my legs
I have just what you need
I have met him many times
I have my share of doubts
I have no control over it
I have not seen him since
I have nothing else to do
I have run short of money
I have said no such thing
I have six mouths to feed
I have some gifts for you
I have some money with me
I have some reading to do
I have some very bad news
I have some very sad news
I have to clean the house
I have to get dressed now
I have to make a decision
I have to make some calls
I have to take the chance
I heard a noise behind me
I heard you bought a boat
I hope he will get better
I hope this data is wrong
I hope you can forgive me
I hope you two are hungry
I just found an old diary
I just found out about it
I just got here last week
I just got some good news
I just kept my mouth shut
I just need a little time
I just want a normal life
I just want to be perfect
I just want to watch this
I just want you to listen
I kind of like this place
I kissed her on the mouth
I knew my time would come
I knew there was a reason
I knew this was a mistake
I knew you were behind it
I know exactly how it was
I know exactly what to do
I know exactly where I am
I know how to handle this
I know how to settle this
I know just what you need
I know that Tom loves you
I know that was a mistake
I know that you live here
I know what it feels like
I know what this is about
I know who asked you here
I know you hired a lawyer
I know you must be afraid
I left the money with him
I like both dogs and cats
I like the way she smiles
I like to help my friends
I like to play with words
I like your hair that way
I live and work in France
I looked all over for Tom
I love both cats and dogs
I love going to the beach
I love the way Tom thinks
I love you more than ever
I may actually have to go
I may give it another try
I may have made a mistake
I must have caught a cold
I need a little help here
I need a little more time
I need a receipt for that
I need change for the bus
I need some time to think
I need someone to hold me
I need this more than you
I need to borrow your car
I need to borrow your pen
I need to buy some stamps
I need to change my shirt
I need to change my tires
I need to find a restroom
I need to get started now
I need to see you tonight
I need to take Monday off
I need to take your pulse
I need to talk to someone
I need to write that down
I often stay up all night
I perspire a lot at night
I planned a party for Tom
I plucked a daisy for her
I prefer to go by bicycle
I punched him in the chin
I rarely go to the movies
I read a lot of magazines
I read all kinds of books
I read the New York Times
I really do love your tie
I really feel like a beer
I really need a drink now
I really want to kiss you
I really want you to quit
I reckon you should do it
I saw Tom three hours ago
I saw her spike his drink
I saw him enter the store
I saw him three years ago
I see how dangerous it is
I should get back to work
I shut the door behind me
I smoked when I was young
I sold it for ten dollars
I stayed at a cheap hotel
I studied a lot in school
I suppose I could do that
I suppose you have a plan
I suspected he was a liar
I think I broke his heart
I think I can answer that
I think I see the problem
I think I touched a nerve
I think Tom can help Mary
I think Tom could be sick
I think Tom has gone away
I think Tom will tell you
I think about Tom all day
I think that he has mumps
I think that he is honest
I think that was the plan
I think the story is true
I think we have a problem
I think we need more food
I think we need more time
I think you can handle it
I think you did very well
I think you might like it
I think you might need me
I think you need a lawyer
I think you should get it
I think you should go now
I thought I heard a voice
I thought I was too young
I thought about you a lot
I thought it might be you
I thought it was a secret
I thought it would be fun
I thought that was my job
I used to like folk music
I usually get what I want
I usually go home at four
I waited for him till ten
I want a few more minutes
I want someone to talk to
I want the truth from you
I want to avoid rush hour
I want to be a lumberjack
I want to be an astronaut
I want to become a singer
I want to change my shirt
I want to eat Korean food
I want to figure this out
I want to forget about it
I want to hear you scream
I want to join your group
I want to know the reason
I want to know who called
I want to make this quick
I want to play the guitar
I want to scratch my nose
I want to see your mother
I want to shake your hand
I want to stretch my legs
I want to travel with you
I want to watch you dance
I want to write this down
I want you to be prepared
I want you to go upstairs
I want you to handle this
I want you to work harder
I wanted to show you this
I wanted to talk about it
I wanted to tell you that
I wanted to watch you die
I wanted to wish you well
I wanted you to have this
I wanted you to keep that
I was afraid he might die
I was afraid of my father
I was always good at math
I was as surprised as you
I was barely able to work
I was chilled to the bone
I was hurt by many people
I was in my room studying
I was in pretty bad shape
I was just about to leave
I was just trying to help
I was meaning to call you
I was only trying to help
I was shocked to see that
I was shocked to see this
I was so drunk last night
I was there the other day
I was told to contact you
I was too stunned to talk
I was trying to kill time
I was trying to reach you
I was up almost all night
I went on with my reading
I will act on your advice
I will always be with you
I will choose one of them
I will fight to the death
I will give you this book
I will look the other way
I will not stand for this
I will speak to him alone
I wish I could explain it
I wish I had more friends
I wish she were alive now
I wish that were the case
I wish we could live here
I wish you had been there
I woke up with a headache
I wonder if he is married
I wonder if this is wrong
I wonder if we could talk
I wonder what his name is
I wonder what it could be
I wonder who that girl is
I wonder who this is from
I work at the post office
I work for an oil company
I work hard in the garden
I work out whenever I can
I would like to eat there
I would like to visit you
I would never do it again
I wrote to her last month
If only I could go skiing
If only I could sing well
If only he had been there
It is easy to play tennis
It is impossible to do it
It is made partly of wood
It is no use trying again
It is out of the question
It is quiet here at night
It is their right to vote
It keeps you on your toes
It made me laugh out loud
It may rain at any moment
It nearly cost me my life
It rained a lot last year
It rains a lot in Okinawa
It snowed a lot last year
It was a crime of passion
It was a revelation to me
It was a stroke of genius
It was a very cold winter
It was just a lucky guess
It was nothing but a joke
It was nowhere to be seen
It would be better to try
Keep your eye on the ball
Let me ask you a question
Let me help you with that
Let me pay for the dinner
Mary is not wearing a bra
Maybe it was just a fluke
Mom bought a puppy for us
Mother made a doll for me
Mother made me a new suit
My aunt lives in New York
My book bag is very heavy
My boss is a slave driver
My brother is at his desk
My brother is out of work
My car needs to be washed
My dog barks all the time
My dream went up in smoke
My father has a red beard
My father is on the wagon
My heart was in my throat
My house has a small yard
My house is built of wood
My job is dull and boring
My mom works in a factory
My mother has a red apron
My phone was out of order
My place is with them now
My wife is a good manager
Never tell me a lie again
No one is in the bathroom
No one is listening to me
No one knew Tom was there
No one knows where Tom is
No one knows where we are
No one will ever find you
No one will speak for you
No one will speak with me
None of the cars are mine
None of the money is mine
Not all men are like that
Not all of them are happy
One of my bags is missing
One of the guards is dead
Only God can help you now
Our cat is in the kitchen
Our fate is in your hands
Our fence is made of iron
Our guests are in a hurry
Park the car in the shade
Part of the story is true
Pick one up while you can
Put more salt in the soup
Put the tables end to end
Put your hands in the air
School is a waste of time
Scream as loud as you can
Send for a doctor at once
She advised him not to go
She always gets up at six
She bought me a nice coat
She cut the apple in half
She did not marry the man
She did not read the book
She died in a plane crash
She fell in love with him
She felt happy to see him
She gave me a pretty doll
She had tears in her eyes
She has a small black dog
She has a very good voice
She has an eye for beauty
She has not come here yet
She hit him with a hammer
She is a really good girl
She is a very nice person
She is a very poor driver
She is after a better job
She is amusing to be with
She is behind in her rent
She is her old self again
She is kind to old people
She is really a nice girl
She is very angry with me
She lived next door to us
She lives next door to us
She must be angry with me
She must be on cloud nine
She put sheets on her bed
She refused to go with me
She runs faster than I do
She served us a good meal
She showed me her new car
She slept for a few hours
She taught me how to swim
She tied him to the chair
She told him not to worry
She took him to the store
She turned her back to me
She used to live near him
She was afraid of the dog
She was aware of his eyes
She was brought up by him
She was going up a ladder
She was injured in a fall
She was now out of danger
She was out when I called
She was too tired to work
She went on with the work
She will have her own way
She will make a good wife
She worked for a rich man
Take the pan off the fire
Tell me what your name is
Tell me why he was absent
Tell me why she is crying
That gave me a rough idea
That might be a good idea
That was a very sad story
That would be a good idea
The bell has not rung yet
The box was full of books
The company is in the red
The deer ran for its life
The doctor gave it to her
The doctor gave me a shot
The dog was out of breath
The dog will not harm you
The girl has a soft heart
The girl seems to be rich
The glass is full of milk
The house is owned by him
The image is not in focus
The keys are on the table
The meat has begun to rot
The milk is in the fridge
The money is on the table
The odds are in his favor
The old man sat all alone
The old woman is a doctor
The phone is out of order
The piano has a good tone
The radio is out of order
The school is on the hill
The sky was full of stars
The sun has not risen yet
The tree bent in the wind
The wind blew her hat off
There is a letter for you
There was no trace of him
They did not give up hope
They do it faster than me
They do it faster than us
They eat meat once a week
They forgot to wake me up
They gave him up for lost
They looked up at the sky
They made us work all day
They plan to have a party
They set out for New York
They tried to cheer me up
They were scared to do it
They were very kind to me
They will be safe with me
This CD belongs to my son
This bike is easy to ride
This book is easy to read
This book is not for sale
This book is of great use
This box is made of paper
This fish has a bad smell
This is a very small book
This is not my first time
This is not to his liking
This is our last day here
This is the flag of Japan
This makes no sense to me
This plant is good to eat
This stove is easy to use
This was part of the plan
This was too much for Tom
Tom and I are married now
Tom and Mary both said no
Tom asked me to come here
Tom asked me to marry him
Tom can walk on his hands
Tom did a pretty good job
Tom died about a year ago
Tom drank a cup of coffee
Tom drank a glass of wine
Tom drew his gun and shot
Tom gives us what we need
Tom gives us what we want
Tom got kicked by a horse
Tom has a house in Boston
Tom has a lot of problems
Tom has been up all night
Tom has to learn to relax
Tom held Mary in his arms
Tom is a very good friend
Tom is a very wealthy man
Tom is almost ready to go
Tom is going to regret it
Tom is going to stay here
Tom is going to try again
Tom is here to protect me
Tom is in the living room
Tom is in the other truck
Tom is there to help Mary
Tom is too young for that
Tom knew he had a problem
Tom left his kids at home
Tom lives next door to us
Tom ordered Mary to do it
Tom refused to talk to me
Tom said he would be here
Tom said that he liked me
Tom said that he was busy
Tom sat down next to Mary
Tom sat down on the couch
Tom showed his room to me
Tom taught me how to cook
Tom told Mary he was busy
Tom told me he was single
Tom took the easy way out
Tom tried to lift the box
Tom wanted to be a farmer
Tom wants me to coach him
Tom wants to be with Mary
Tom wants to come with us
Tom was able to help Mary
Tom was alone at the time
Tom was bitten by a cobra
Tom was here a minute ago
Tom was here before I was
Tom was unsure what to do
Tom will be wearing a tie
Traveling is a lot of fun
Trim the fat off the meat
Try not to make him angry
Try not to think about it
We all miss you very much
We all want to be desired
We already gave it to you
We began on a new project
We began our work at noon
We bought a lot of stamps
We can be certain of that
We can save you some time
We could keep it a secret
We eat many kinds of food
We had a lot of furniture
We had a really good time
We had our roof blown off
We have all kinds of time
We have been up all night
We have half a dozen eggs
We have lost sight of him
We have run short of food
We have six lessons a day
We have to obey the rules
We have to talk right now
We hope to meet you again
We lived close by the sea
We might need to help Tom
We moved into a new house
We must do this right now
We must tell him about it
We offered him a nice job
We regard him as our hero
We saw her enter the room
We stayed at a nice hotel
We take good care of them
We think the world of you
We want them to follow us
We want to know the facts
We want to speak with Tom
We were caught in a storm
We will fight to the last
We work from nine to five
What he did is very wrong
What he said was not true
What you need is a friend
What you said is not true
Whoever says so is a liar
You are both in the wrong
You are in over your head
You can do that right now
You can tear the box open
You can tell me the truth
You could hear a pin drop
You have a sense of humor
You have a way with women
You have given me so many
You have to stay in shape
You have to take a shower
You know what you must do
You know where to find me
You look good in a kimono
You may stay here with me
You must not eat too much
You must not give up hope
You must not go out today
You must not shout at him
You must not stay up late
You need to get some rest
You need to wear a tuxedo
You ought to have seen it
You said you had a theory
You should go talk to him
Your watch is on the desk
A cry arose from the crowd
A heavy rain began to fall
A major is above a captain
A man appeared at the door
A mist hung over the river
A shiver ran down my spine
A student wants to see you
A wink was his only answer
All is well that ends well
All of the dogs were alive
An apple fell off the tree
An apple sits on the table
Ask him the way to station
Basketball is a lot of fun
Be sure to bring rain gear
Best wishes from all of us
Both of them are very cute
Call us when you get there
Come over here and join us
Dry your face with a towel
Each of them has a bicycle
Eggs are sold by the dozen
English is not easy for me
English is not easy for us
Get this stuff out of here
Give it to anyone you like
Give me another cup of tea
Give me back the TV remote
Give me some time to think
Good luck with the new job
Hang your coat on the hook
He advised me not to smoke
He almost got away with it
He appealed to us for help
He asked that we be silent
He became a nice young man
He began to whistle a tune
He bought his son a camera
He bought me a nice camera
He called me up from Tokyo
He carved me a wooden doll
He caught hold of the rope
He comes here once a month
He comes here twice a week
He could not go to college
He dashed out of the store
He decided to sell the car
He did it out of curiosity
He did well for a beginner
He does it faster than you
He drank a shot of whiskey
He forgot to lock the door
He gave away all his money
He gave her a foot massage
He got bogged down at work
He got kicked off the team
He greeted me with a smile
He grew a variety of crops
He had an accident at work
He has an eye for antiques
He has any number of books
He has her under his thumb
He has quite a few records
He held the trophy up high
He invited me to his house
He invited me to the party
He is a good tennis player
He is a really good worker
He is a student at Harvard
He is a teacher of English
He is absorbed in his work
He is afraid of his father
He is almost six feet tall
He is always full of ideas
He is engaged to my sister
He is going to the concert
He is hunted by the police
He is impatient to see you
He is not guilty of murder
He is not strong as before
He is now staying in Paris
He is one of my neighbours
He is popular with his men
He is sitting on the chair
He is standing on the hill
He is still full of energy
He is studying at his desk
He is swimming in the pool
He is very a dangerous man
He is worthy of our praise
He laid himself on the bed
He left after he had lunch
He lives in a trailer park
He looks like a clever boy
He made a journey to Paris
He made her clean the room
He made his will last year
He made up the whole story
He motioned me to stand up
He nearly got away with it
He never cared much for me
He ran away with the money
He reads a novel every day
He said he could swim well
He said hello to the woman
He seems to have been rich
He sent me a birthday card
He shared his soup with me
He should be put in prison
He stayed at a cheap hotel
He still has much to learn
He stood there for a while
He stopped to talk to them
He told me all the details
He took credit for my idea
He touched me on the cheek
He turned pale at the news
He turned up an hour later
He walked all the way home
He walked on for some time
He wants to be an engineer
He wants to squish the bug
He warned me of the danger
He was absent at roll call
He was anxious to meet you
He was caught in an ambush
He was fired by the school
He was killed with a sword
He was robbed of his youth
He was struck off the list
He was too stunned to talk
He was wounded in the head
He will always be with you
He will be waiting for her
He will be waiting for you
He will get well very soon
He will make a good doctor
He wished he had more time
He won the prize last week
He works as a ghost writer
Her father is a bank clerk
Her home is in the suburbs
Her old cat is still alive
Her son is sure to succeed
Here is one of my pictures
His life was full of drama
His old cat is still alive
His sons do as they please
I agree with what you said
I am an optimist by nature
I am at home every evening
I am counting on your help
I am going down the stairs
I am just a humble teacher
I am never free on Sundays
I am playing the piano now
I am tired of hearing that
I am very happy in Georgia
I argued with him about it
I arrived in Tokyo at noon
I ate with my baby brother
I belong to the music club
I bought that book for Tom
I brought one just in case
I came into a huge fortune
I can easily touch my toes
I can imagine how you felt
I catch the flu every year
I caught a cold last month
I caught up with them soon
I could never be like that
I could use a little sleep
I cover twenty miles a day
I did not take many photos
I doubt if he will succeed
I figured it out by myself
I folded the towel in half
I forgot to call him today
I forgot to do my homework
I forgot what his name was
I forgot where the car was
I found the book by chance
I gave him my phone number
I gave you what you wanted
I go home right after work
I go right home after work
I got my hands quite dirty
I got my right leg injured
I got over my cold quickly
I got so wasted last night
I got up late this morning
I got you something to eat
I grow many kinds of roses
I had a great time tonight
I had a sandwich for lunch
I had dinner ready for you
I had planned to go abroad
I had to decline his offer
I had to work last weekend
I hardly ever run into him
I hate to see children cry
I have a burning pain here
I have a few English books
I have a friend in England
I have almost no money now
I have been busy this week
I have been to the library
I have better things to do
I have faith in the future
I have just read this book
I have less money than you
I have my doubts about Tom
I have never been to Nikko
I have never heard him lie
I have not seen him lately
I have nothing left to say
I have nothing to do today
I have once been to Europe
I have only a small garden
I have other plans for you
I have read all his novels
I have seen him many times
I have some errands to run
I have some shopping to do
I have something in my eye
I have to answer the phone
I have to button my jacket
I have to buy one tomorrow
I have to catch that train
I have to talk to somebody
I heard that she came here
I hid myself under the bed
I hope Tom proves me wrong
I hope he will overlook it
I hope you will call again
I just feel a little dizzy
I just found out last week
I just got my first tattoo
I just saw a shooting star
I just want to be prepared
I just want to get married
I just wanted to say hello
I knew Tom would like Mary
I knew exactly what it was
I knew it would be painful
I knew that he was reading
I knew this day was coming
I knew this day would come
I knew who my enemies were
I know Tom likes to travel
I know he likes jazz music
I know some of these girls
I know that Tom likes jazz
I know what you were doing
I left my umbrella at home
I like having plenty to do
I like playing with my dog
I like seeing you this way
I like the way that smells
I like the way this tastes
I like this city very much
I like to feed the pigeons
I like to travel by myself
I like your new hair color
I live pretty close to Tom
I lost sight of my friends
I love going to the movies
I love my mother very much
I love seeing you so happy
I loved going to the beach
I made him change his plan
I made him sweep the floor
I maxed out my credit card
I may not have enough time
I met her at Tokyo Station
I met his sister last week
I met your father just now
I must brush up my English
I must have made a mistake
I need a bigger frying pan
I need a few minutes alone
I need a little more space
I need nine hours of sleep
I need to go eat something
I need to know by tomorrow
I need to lose five pounds
I need to lose some weight
I need to press the button
I never did like it anyway
I never really knew my dad
I never wanted to harm you
I never wanted to hurt you
I no longer live in Boston
I often sing in the shower
I own some very old stamps
I paid five dollars to him
I pointed my camera at her
I prefer red wine to white
I promised not to tell him
I rarely talk on the phone
I read a book while eating
I really do need your help
I really have to get going
I really hope you can come
I really want to thank you
I returned his book to him
I said nothing of the sort
I said that I was confused
I saw a little boy running
I saw him cross the street
I saw his mother scold him
I saw land in the distance
I saw that Tom was smiling
I slept with my clothes on
I slept with the light off
I smiled and waved at them
I suggest we all calm down
I suppose we could do that
I think Tom is still alive
I think Tom wanted my help
I think Tom wants our help
I think about it every day
I think it just might work
I think it was an accident
I think it will rain today
I think maybe Tom needs me
I think maybe we should go
I think that might be wise
I think that would be best
I think that would be nice
I think that would be wise
I think they went this way
I think we can handle that
I think we can handle this
I think we need more water
I think we should break up
I think we should call Tom
I think we should hire Tom
I think we should sit down
I think we should stop now
I think you knew my father
I think you need some rest
I think you really mean it
I think you should ask Tom
I thought I was alone here
I thought Tom was a doctor
I thought Tom was a farmer
I thought Tom was with you
I thought that he was rich
I thought we had more time
I told Tom we were friends
I took Tom to the hospital
I took her for an American
I took part in the contest
I try not to bother anyone
I turned to him for advice
I want a dozen cream puffs
I want a kitchen like this
I want more days like this
I want somebody to talk to
I want those kids to leave
I want to change the world
I want to date other women
I want to drink some water
I want to file a complaint
I want to make a complaint
I want to make a statement
I want to make new friends
I want to meet the teacher
I want to see what happens
I want to serve my country
I want to stay here longer
I want to think for myself
I want you gone by sunrise
I want you to go somewhere
I warned him of the danger
I was arrested on the spot
I was blinded by the light
I was born and raised here
I was feeling blue all day
I was ignorant of his plan
I was in London last month
I was just taking a shower
I was married at that time
I was reading a novel then
I was really proud of that
I was taking a shower then
I was tired of watching TV
I was unable to go outside
I was young and crazy once
I watched a movie on video
I went out with my friends
I went swimming in the sea
I went to bed after eating
I will bring it right away
I will do anything for him
I will do anything for you
I will do whatever you ask
I will go abroad next year
I will stop him from going
I will write you back soon
I wish I could believe you
I wish I could play guitar
I wish I could stay longer
I wish I earned more money
I wish Tom would stop that
I wish the rain would stop
I wish to make a complaint
I wonder if she is married
I wonder what Tom would do
I wonder where he has gone
I wonder whose car this is
I wonder why he was absent
I work for a travel agency
I would like a little wine
I would never let you down
I write every chance I get
It is just half past seven
It is likely to rain today
It is neither good nor bad
It is raining all the time
It is wrong to steal money
It may occur at any moment
It may rain in the evening
It may snow in the evening
It seemed like a good idea
It sounds like a good plan
It was a very long meeting
It was a warm summer night
It was fun while it lasted
It was love at first sight
It was nice and cool there
It was not always this way
It was one of those things
It was the best party ever
It will only hurt a little
It will only take a minute
Just tell me what you want
Keep your eyes on the road
Leave that box where it is
Let me buy you another one
Let me give you an example
Let me paint you a picture
Let me pay for your coffee
Let me put off my decision
Let me show you an example
Lie down on your left side
Life has its ups and downs
Listen to what I am saying
Lying to Tom was a mistake
Make a copy of this report
Make good use of your time
Man has the gift of speech
Many young men went to war
Maybe I should go with you
Most of the dogs are alive
My aunt lived a happy life
My bicycle has a flat tire
My brother works in a bank
My car is at your disposal
My dog is wagging his tail
My father bought a new car
My father is in the garden
My father must do the work
My father works for a bank
My hair has grown too long
My knife has lost its edge
My mom walked into my room
My papers were in that box
My parents let me go there
My room has a large closet
My sister is a good typist
My uncle is a lousy driver
My uncle lives in New York
My watch needs to be fixed
No one could find the cave
No one trusts him any more
No one would talk about it
Nobody is too old to learn
None of the money is yours
None of the rooms is ready
None of this is your fault
Not every man can be happy
Not everyone can be a poet
Now is the time for action
Open your book to page ten
Pink is not just for girls
Please let me try it again
Please let me try the game
Please show it to me again
Put in a little more sugar
Put some salt on your meat
Put that back on the table
Put that book aside for me
Put the carrots in the pot
Put the coat on the hanger
Put the flour on the shelf
She acted like a real baby
She advised me to go there
She asked him to marry her
She asked me to bring them
She bought a shirt for him
She bought an album for me
She called while I was out
She came to like the house
She decided to be a doctor
She did not come until two
She felt very bad that day
She forced him to sit down
She forgot to feed her dog
She forgot to feed the dog
She gave him the brush off
She gave me a strange look
She gave us a vague answer
She goes to school on foot
She got no answer from him
She got the money from him
She had her hair cut short
She had to accept her fate
She has a passion for cake
She has a sense of fashion
She has a very good figure
She has long arms and legs
She has never been in love
She held him by the sleeve
She helped him tie his tie
She invited me to her home
She is a very good teacher
She is always hard at work
She is anxious to meet you
She is ashamed to speak up
She is forbidden to go out
She is her own worst enemy
She is much taller than me
She is nothing but a child
She is older and wiser now
She is quite a clever girl
She likes her school a lot
She lives in a large house
She lives next door to him
She looks as young as ever
She managed to drive a car
She persuaded him to do it
She plays the piano by ear
She quoted a poem by Keats
She read the poem out loud
She saw him at the station
She saw me enter the store
She says that she is happy
She seems happy to be here
She seems to have been ill
She set a new world record
She showed her album to me
She spoke to me in Spanish
She stared him in the face
She stayed out in the rain
She told him to try harder
She took care of his wound
She took care of the child
She took me for my brother
She used to live in luxury
She waited for him to call
She wants to be a designer
She was alone in the house
She was asked to the party
She whispered it in my ear
She wrote me a long letter
Some boats are on the lake
Some of the dogs are alive
Stay calm and do your best
Stay here and wait for her
Stay here and wait for him
Stop trying to cheer me up
Summer is coming to an end
Take a book from the shelf
Take a look at this report
Take all the time you need
Take all the time you want
Take the road on the right
Tell them what you told me
Thanks a lot for your help
That bottle is in the dirt
That girl looks like a boy
That hat looks good on you
That is no business of his
That is what this is about
That job bores me to death
That must be the city hall
That soil is rich in humus
That tie looks good on you
That will be all for today
That will buy us some time
That would be a good start
That young lady is a nurse
The boat can still be seen
The book fell to the floor
The box he found was empty
The box was open and empty
The boy is full of promise
The boy made a paper plane
The boys played in the mud
The boys swam in the river
The call is free of charge
The car turned to the left
The castle is now in ruins
The cat is under the table
The city fell to the enemy
The cows are milked at six
The dog came running to me
The dog was burnt to death
The dog was digging a hole
The eagle is about to land
The floor had a good shine
The fruit is in the basket
The house is made of stone
The idea is typical of him
The joke was at my expense
The law is not always fair
The lion is king of beasts
The main tap is turned off
The man blushed like a boy
The man leapt to his death
The noise got on my nerves
The old man died last week
The old man died of cancer
The party is in full swing
The phone was off the hook
The price of gas is rising
The roof is made of thatch
The room is full of people
The room was full of smoke
The seats are all sold out
The silver is on the table
The storm blew down a tree
The story is full of holes
The street is full of cars
The water has been cut off
The world is a crazy place
The world is full of fools
There are too many of them
There is a message for you
There was fear in his eyes
There were ten eggs in all
These new cars are on sale
They all envied my new car
They are in the same class
They cut my hair too short
They heard it on the radio
They just want to have fun
They let me pick a present
They made fun of my accent
They seem to be having fun
They slept in the same bed
They want to do this right
They will be safe with her
They will be safe with him
This book seems easy to me
This bus is going to Minsk
This car is easy to handle
This car was made in Japan
This drink is on the house
This house is not for sale
This house is not very big
This is a book about stars
This is also my first time
This is between you and me
This is going to get messy
This is just what I wanted
This is never going to end
This is not what I ordered
This is where my dad works
This job is kind of boring
This product is fun to use
This road goes to the park
This shoe is a size bigger
Tie the horse to that tree
Tom and I are good friends
Tom and Mary have two cats
Tom asked Mary to the prom
Tom asked me where I lived
Tom ate up all the cookies
Tom beckoned me to come in
Tom bet on the wrong horse
Tom brought us each a gift
Tom came half an hour late
Tom changes his mind a lot
Tom cooks for us every day
Tom decided to risk it all
Tom drank a glass of water
Tom elbowed me in the ribs
Tom failed to come on time
Tom fell flat on the floor
Tom fell in love with Mary
Tom felt a little left out
Tom forgot to feed the dog
Tom forgot to pay his rent
Tom gave me a vague answer
Tom got his head bashed in
Tom had blood on his shoes
Tom handed the map to Mary
Tom has a dog named Cookie
Tom has a friend in Boston
Tom has a surprise for you
Tom has nobody to help him
Tom has nowhere left to go
Tom helped us push the car
Tom hid it behind the door
Tom is a real estate agent
Tom is able to play soccer
Tom is ashamed of his body
Tom is asleep in his chair
Tom is asleep on the couch
Tom is at church right now
Tom is even scared of Mary
Tom is hardly ever at home
Tom is my only real friend
Tom is now older and wiser
Tom is playing with my cat
Tom is seldom ever on time
Tom is sitting at his desk
Tom is sitting in the back
Tom is talking to Mary now
Tom is wearing a black hat
Tom is wearing a black tie
Tom is working on your car
Tom just showed up at work
Tom keeps hanging up on me
Tom knows he has no choice
Tom left me with no choice
Tom looks older than he is
Tom looks proud of his son
Tom only had eyes for Mary
Tom ran the fastest of all
Tom read the poem out loud
Tom really does talk a lot
Tom risked his life for us
Tom said he found his keys
Tom said he wanted to help
Tom said he wanted to talk
Tom sat on the window sill
Tom saw that Mary was busy
Tom says that he knows you
Tom should be ready by now
Tom swims better than I do
Tom talks about that a lot
Tom told me he was working
Tom took a bath last night
Tom took a lot of pictures
Tom tore the paper in half
Tom treats me like a child
Tom tried to cheer Mary up
Tom tried to hide his fear
Tom tried to open the door
Tom walked out of the room
Tom wants Mary to be happy
Tom wants to be a stuntman
Tom wants to join our club
Tom was bullied as a child
Tom was trying to be funny
Tom went back to the hotel
Tom will be back home soon
Tom will be back next week
Tom will be waiting for me
Tom will take care of this
Try not to look so nervous
Try to stay out of trouble
Turn the radio up a little
Use your head for a change
Wait here till I come back
We all die sooner or later
We all want prices to fall
We all want the same thing
We also went to the temple
We are about to leave here
We are going to the market
We are not to be disturbed
We are sure of his success
We do all kinds of repairs
We elected him to be mayor
We forgot to lock the door
We gather here once a week
We grow a variety of crops
We had to abandon our plan
We have a big day tomorrow
We have a decision to make
We have a traitor among us
We have other things to do
We have plenty of time now
We have to change our plan
We have to do the shopping
We have to make a decision
We just have to be patient
We live near a big library
We look out for each other
We lost all of our funding
We may have missed the bus
We must always do our best
We must leave here at once
We need to have a contract
We need to help each other
We need to talk about this
We persuaded him not to go
We should be there by noon
We stayed at a cheap hotel
We think that he will come
We thought you could do it
We used to be best friends
We want peace in the world
We welcome you to our club
We went to the video store
We were back to square one
We were driven to the wall
We will keep the room warm
What he said made us angry
What he said might be true
Wipe your shoes on the mat
You and I are good friends
You are on the wrong plane
You are on the wrong train
You are taller than she is
You came at the right time
You can always count on me
You can choose one of them
You can leave the room now
You can open your eyes now
You can sleep on the couch
You can smoke in this room
You can still see the ship
You can visit NHK any time
You had better not do that
You have got to be kidding
You have the right to know
You have to pay in advance
You look good in that suit
You made a bargain with us
You may choose any of them
You may choose one of them
You may not like this book
You may now kiss the bride
You must know that I snore
You must not open the door
You ought to see a dentist
You put in too much pepper
You should do it like this
You should go to bed early
You will have a new sister
You write better than I do
Your life may be in danger
Your plan is bound to fail
A cat ran across the street
A cookie is under the table
A dog suddenly jumped at me
A fire broke out last night
A friend told me that story
A good idea occurred to him
A good memory is his weapon
A lot of soldiers died here
A stitch in time saves nine
All of the milk was spilled
All of them are not present
All they had was each other
All was silent in the house
Americans eat a lot of meat
An apple fell to the ground
Any amount of money will do
Anywhere with a bed will do
Ask her when she comes back
Be kind to those around you
Be more careful from now on
Believe that if you want to
Birds are flying in the air
Books are made out of paper
Both of my parents are dead
Both you and I are students
Come into the room after me
Dad gave me a computer game
Do it yourself by all means
Do not attempt this at home
Fasten the rope to the tree
Food is fuel for our bodies
Girls say that all the time
Give it to whoever needs it
Give it to whoever wants it
Go and help wash the dishes
Go back to where you belong
Go two blocks and turn left
Green is the color of money
Guess what I did last night
Hang the mirror on the wall
He achieved his aim at last
He arrived after I had left
He arrived the day she left
He asked me a few questions
He asked me what I expected
He asked me where she lived
He blamed me for not coming
He bore a grudge against me
He bought himself a new car
He calls her up every night
He came back two days later
He can pull strings for you
He claims that he is honest
He cleared the path of snow
He cleared the roof of snow
He died from lack of oxygen
He died of cancer last year
He explained the rule to me
He feels a lot better today
He fell into a deep slumber
He gave me his phone number
He got engaged to my cousin
He got sick during the trip
He got the book for nothing
He grabbed me by the collar
He had barely enough to eat
He had the gift of prophecy
He had the table to himself
He had to leave the village
He has a grudge against you
He helped me do my homework
He insisted that I join him
He is a novelist and artist
He is a promising young man
He is almost always at home
He is always friendly to me
He is an authority on China
He is clumsy with his hands
He is digging his own grave
He is good at taking photos
He is in his early thirties
He is innocent of the crime
He is more crafty than wise
He is no longer living here
He is not likely to succeed
He is not very good company
He is on night duty tonight
He is pleased with his work
He is rather hard to please
He is standing on the stage
He is still very much alive
He is suffering from a cold
He is the head of marketing
He keeps a diary in English
He kept on reading the book
He kept walking all the day
He lives alone in the woods
He looked at me in surprise
He looks like an honest man
He made up his mind quickly
He makes believe he is rich
He never laughs at my jokes
He pretended not to be hurt
He pretended not to hear me
He pretended not to know me
He pretended to be a doctor
He received a lot of praise
He repaired my watch for me
He rolled over in his sleep
He rushed out of the office
He shaves four times a week
He showed us a few pictures
He shut the door behind him
He slipped on a banana peel
He sometimes drops in on me
He treats me like his slave
He vowed to give up smoking
He wants to save the planet
He was also kind to animals
He was ashamed of his tears
He was caught by the police
He was hurt in the accident
He was ignorant of the fact
He was laughed at in public
He was not at all satisfied
He was right the first time
He was sitting on the floor
He was standing at the door
He went there instead of me
He will be at home tomorrow
He will be here all evening
He will be writing a letter
He worked from nine to five
He works at a tattoo parlor
Her dream is to visit Paris
Her husband is about to die
Her mother became mad at us
Her remark got on my nerves
His brother was nasty to me
His cottage is on the coast
His eyes were full of tears
His house was small and old
His job is to teach English
His theory is based on fact
I accompanied her on a walk
I admit that I was careless
I advise you to be punctual
I almost feel sorry for you
I am grateful for your help
I am looking for my brother
I am looking for my glasses
I am not certain about that
I am prepared for the worst
I am running short of money
I am very sensitive to heat
I apologize for what I said
I arrived at school on time
I asked her for her address
I believe in what they said
I believe the answer is yes
I believe you like your job
I belong to a swimming club
I belong to the karate club
I bet it will rain tomorrow
I bought a pair of scissors
I bought it for ten dollars
I bought two pairs of pants
I buy milk almost every day
I can only import GIF files
I can only speak for myself
I can see right through you
I can see through your lies
I can show you the pictures
I can teach you my language
I could see nothing but fog
I could sure use that money
I crossed the river by boat
I cut myself with a hacksaw
I did everything I could do
I disagree with you on this
I do not accept your excuse
I dream of seeing him there
I eat meat almost every day
I enlisted in the Air Force
I expect you to work harder
I explained the rule to him
I feel good after a workout
I feel like a million bucks
I feel like going out today
I felt exactly the same way
I felt like I was intruding
I forgot to lock the drawer
I found the food too greasy
I found this under your bed
I gave way to their demands
I get a haircut every month
I go to church every Sunday
I got caught in a rainstorm
I got my hair cut yesterday
I got the pears for nothing
I got this bicycle for free
I got up earlier than usual
I got up early this morning
I guess we should leave now
I had a good time yesterday
I had intended to go abroad
I had my thumbnail torn off
I had never seen him before
I had no right to interfere
I had things to think about
I had to go there yesterday
I hardly ever go to museums
I hate seeing you like this
I have a bad headache today
I have a slight fever today
I have already done my work
I have been honest with him
I have been looking for you
I have been to London twice
I have fewer books than you
I have never been to Europe
I have never read that book
I have no objection to that
I have no problem with this
I have nothing better to do
I have nothing else to wear
I have nothing left to lose
I have read the book before
I have seen the film before
I have something to ask Tom
I have three tickets for it
I have to answer his letter
I have to borrow some money
I heard from him last month
I heard the front door slam
I held my breath and waited
I helped Tom do some chores
I helped him carry his desk
I hid it under the mattress
I hope that he will succeed
I hope you enjoyed the show
I intended to start at once
I invited them to the party
I just have a few questions
I just have to do something
I just want to be different
I just wanted to be popular
I just wanted to go jogging
I just wanted to play poker
I just wanted to say thanks
I knew Tom would forgive me
I know exactly how you feel
I know what can happen here
I know what happened to Tom
I know what may happen here
I know where the blame goes
I like hanging out with you
I like her sister very much
I like rice more than bread
I like the music of Austria
I like this one even better
I like to make people happy
I live pretty close to here
I love hanging out with you
I love it when that happens
I love sitting on the beach
I made that dress by myself
I must speak with you alone
I need somebody I can trust
I need to borrow some money
I need to handle this alone
I need to renew my passport
I never drink tea with milk
I never get sick of dancing
I never knew his first name
I never made such a promise
I never said you were lying
I never talked to him again
I never want to get married
I often have the same dream
I only ask out of curiosity
I only did the bare minimum
I only drink to be sociable
I only study in the library
I only wanted to be helpful
I owe you a sincere apology
I painted a picture for you
I plan to never get married
I put on some clean clothes
I ran into a little trouble
I read the report you wrote
I really owe you an apology
I received a good job offer
I saw a strange woman there
I saw him crossing the road
I see her sweeping the room
I see nothing wrong with it
I should not have said that
I started a fire right away
I stayed in bed all morning
I stayed up late last night
I still need some help here
I stopped and gazed at them
I suggest you get some rest
I suppose we have no choice
I sure wish you would leave
I take a walk every morning
I take that as a compliment
I thanked Mary for her help
I think I hurt his feelings
I think Tom could do better
I think Tom is following me
I think Tom is here already
I think Tom looks like John
I think Tom needs your help
I think Tom would like that
I think many people do that
I think maybe Tom was right
I think my job is pointless
I think that I should leave
I think that was very funny
I think the mistake is mine
I think this belongs to you
I think this will do nicely
I think we are in agreement
I think we need more coffee
I think we should head back
I think we should leave now
I think we should try again
I think you need a vacation
I think you need some sleep
I think you ought to listen
I think you should see this
I think you should sit down
I thought I was being smart
I thought I was going crazy
I thought Tom was at school
I thought Tom was in prison
I thought Tom was in school
I thought he was my brother
I thought he would be upset
I thought that Tom was kind
I thought that he was angry
I thought that was your job
I thought the game was over
I thought the show was over
I thought you could help me
I thought you liked it here
I thought you were a friend
I told him about our school
I told you it was dangerous
I took an early flight home
I used to have a girlfriend
I used to have a motorcycle
I visit him every other day
I want everybody to go home
I want everyone to be there
I want to ask you something
I want to be your boyfriend
I want to hear your opinion
I want to keep working here
I want to know your opinion
I want to practice with you
I want to return your money
I want to run for president
I want to try something new
I want you home by midnight
I want you to consider this
I want you to follow orders
I want you to speak frankly
I was absent from the party
I was amazed at his courage
I was bored with his speech
I was jealous of my brother
I was never good at grammar
I was quite shocked by this
I was scolded by my teacher
I was starting to lose hope
I was tricked into doing it
I was up all night studying
I went to the wrong address
I went to the zoo yesterday
I will deal with him myself
I will do anything but that
I will have to study harder
I will help you if possible
I will never change my mind
I will not attend the party
I will not be busy tomorrow
I will not be free tomorrow
I wish I were a millionaire
I wonder if dinner is ready
I wonder what it feels like
I wonder where she has gone
I work at a language school
I would rather stay at home
I wrote a letter in English
I wrote a letter last night
It always snows in the Alps
It could cost you your head
It depends on what you mean
It happened a long time ago
It has to be tomorrow night
It is a very strange letter
It is easier than I thought
It is none of your business
It is not the best solution
It is not worth the trouble
It is ten minutes to eleven
It nearly cost him his life
It only takes a few minutes
It rained a lot that winter
It rained three days on end
It was a very exciting game
It was not an easy decision
It was too difficult for me
Keep oil away from the fire
Leave it where you found it
Leave the book where it was
Let me give you some advice
Make a sketch of your house
Mary is alone in the forest
Mary wore a pale blue dress
Maybe she can tell you more
Maybe what you said is true
Milk does not agree with me
Mix the flour with two eggs
Most of my friends are guys
Mother is making tea for us
My blood type is A positive
My boyfriend is not a loser
My clock seems to be broken
My credit card is maxed out
My dream is to study abroad
My family are all very well
My family is not that large
My family is not very large
My father came home at nine
My father has gone to China
My father is a heavy smoker
My father is an early riser
My father is in his fifties
My heart began to beat fast
My house faces to the south
My house is near the church
My house is near the school
My house looks to the south
My jeans shrank in the wash
My mother is an early riser
My mother is in the kitchen
My mother left me a message
My mother made me a sweater
My parents made me go there
My parents were proud of me
My plan was adopted by them
My sister has a sweet tooth
My sister is a good swimmer
My sister is engaged to him
My uncle gave him a present
My uncle gave me this watch
My uncle lived to be ninety
My work is not complete yet
No doubt she will come soon
No one believed me at first
No one here will betray you
No one made you do anything
Nobody had ever heard of it
None of them wanted to talk
Not all girls are like that
Not all of them are present
Not everybody can be a poet
Now shake hands and make up
One of my friends knows you
Open your book to page nine
Our best friend is a doctor
Our lives are in your hands
Our son died during the war
Our teacher is a real idiot
Our team lost all its games
People do that all the time
Please find out where he is
Please let me come with you
Please pour me a little tea
Please speak in a low voice
Pus has formed in the wound
Put the car into the garage
Read the bottom of the page
Rules are made to be broken
See if my answer is correct
Send for the doctor at once
She advised him to go there
She allowed him to go alone
She always gets her own way
She appealed to me for help
She bought her son a camera
She called him on the phone
She came back an hour later
She can never keep a secret
She can play the piano well
She can run a full marathon
She cooked some fish for me
She cooks for him every day
She cut off the carrot tops
She decided on a blue dress
She did it for her children
She did not return till six
She did so out of curiosity
She died in a bike accident
She gave him a nice present
She gave him his first kiss
She gave me these old coins
She grabbed him by the hand
She greeted me with a smile
She greeted us with a smile
She guided me to the palace
She had long hair last year
She handles a saw very well
She has a gift for prophecy
She has buried her only son
She has him under her thumb
She hit him again and again
She is a short story writer
She is always neat and tidy
She is as beautiful as ever
She is dressed like a bride
She is in low spirits today
She is qualified as a nurse
She is sitting on the bench
She is used to living alone
She is very annoyed with me
She is very fond of flowers
She is wearing a blue dress
She is wearing a nice watch
She is writing a letter now
She killed him with a knife
She kissed him on the cheek
She left her ticket at home
She looked at me and smiled
She looks young for her age
She made fun of her husband
She made him clean his room
She may not wait any longer
She misses her family a lot
She needs some help from us
She passed out on the floor
She pushed him off the pier
She pushed him out the door
She put the children to bed
She quit her job last month
She raced him down the hill
She really got on my nerves
She really likes cats a lot
She said she had been happy
She said that she was happy
She sat beside me in church
She seemed to have been ill
She should be there at noon
She slapped him in the face
She stabbed him in the back
She stays in touch with him
She studies as hard as ever
She treated him like a king
She turned pale at the news
She visited him once a year
She visits him twice a year
She wanted to go out anyway
She wants to meet him again
She was robbed of her purse
She was wearing a black hat
She was wearing a blue coat
She will be late for dinner
Some Asian men wear make up
Some of them are my friends
Someone has to pay the bill
Stir the paint with a stick
Take any two cards you like
Take the chair to your room
Tell Tom what Mary told you
Tell Tom where he should go
Tell him where he should go
Tell me where Tom took Mary
Tell me which one to choose
Thank you for all the gifts
Thank you for picking me up
Thank you for the other day
That girl has a lovely doll
That is just typical of him
That is out of the question
That is where you are wrong
That man is unworthy of you
That room is not very large
That seems like a good idea
That town is two miles away
That was a pretty good move
That was just what I needed
That will put you in danger
The Sahara is a vast desert
The air is pure around here
The bill must be paid today
The birds flew to the south
The boat drifted out to sea
The boat sank to the bottom
The boy caught a large fish
The boy hid behind the door
The bridge is built of wood
The bucket is full of water
The bus was hot and crowded
The cat climbed up the tree
The chairs are made of wood
The computer is to her left
The deal did not go through
The devil is in the details
The dog jumped over a chair
The dog was frozen to death
The fire went out by itself
The food was great in Italy
The gate is closed at eight
The girl cried out for help
The house has icicles on it
The ice in the water melted
The island is warm all year
The lake water is very cold
The lid screws onto the jar
The machine is out of order
The museum is worth a visit
The noise gets on my nerves
The north wind blew all day
The police caught him at it
The proof is in the pudding
The roast lamb is very good
The rumor proved to be true
The shop stays open all day
The store is not open today
The suspect is a black male
The teacher let him go home
The train is always on time
The train made a brief stop
The trees will soon be bare
The world is full of idiots
The wound is not yet healed
Their concert was a big hit
Their work seems good to me
There are holes in the roof
There is no hope of success
They agreed to meet me here
They are about the same age
They begged us to help them
They could do with our help
They fight like cat and dog
They found Tom in the crowd
They got to be good friends
They had lost the Civil War
They have to clean the room
They live in a rented house
They live in the same state
They made fun of my clothes
They made us work all night
They saw him enter the room
They slept in the same room
They went on board the ship
This article is of no value
This book is full of errors
This car needs to be washed
This has all been a mistake
This house is far too small
This is a real popular item
This is a time of rejoicing
This is a very scary moment
This is exactly what I want
This is for your own safety
This is getting out of hand
This is how you get results
This is no time for modesty
This is not a small problem
This photo was taken by Tom
This purse is made of paper
This road is closed to cars
This room is not very large
This song is familiar to us
This watch is made in Japan
This water is safe to drink
This will be a game changer
This will not cost too much
Those who know him like him
To know oneself is not easy

Today is not your lucky day

Tom went there to meet Mary
Tom will need to go further
Tom wondered if it was true
Tom writes better than I do
Toss the gun onto the table
Toss your gun on the ground
Try and do better next time
Try not to splatter the ink
Twenty years is a long time
Wait here until I come back
We all care for one another
We all have passed the test
We all live on planet Earth
We are apt to make mistakes
We are having a mild winter
We can hear the dog barking
We could live in peace here
We drink our tea with sugar
We get together once a year
We had better sit down here
We had so much fun together
We have room for three more
We have to do without sugar
We have to expect the worst
We have to study the matter
We hope to lower the tariff
We hope to return next year
We hurried to catch the bus
We invited him to our house
We know so little about Tom
We must carry out that plan
We must never do this again
We need three more of these
We rent movies all the time
We shook nuts from the tree
We should stick to our plan
We sometimes go for a drive
We took him for an American

We were forced to work hard
We were very busy last week
We will die sooner or later

What is needed is more time
What you say makes no sense
You are apt to be forgetful
You are liable for the debt
You are not a child anymore
You are wanted on the phone
You can always count on Tom
You can always quit the job
You can go however you like
You can have it for nothing
You do nothing else but eat
You had better get up early
You have no cause for anger
You have not changed at all
You have to clean your room
You have to respect the old
You look as healthy as ever
You look young for your age
You made a fool of yourself
You may as well go yourself
You may be right about that
You may go where you please
You may leave your bag here
You might want some of this
You must be back before ten
You must be very hungry now
You must let me handle this
You must not enter the room
You must stick to your diet
You need not have called me
You need to be more patient
You need to wash your hands
You never cease to amaze me
You said that you hated Tom
You said that you loved Tom
You should buy him new toys
You should go see a dentist
You should know that by now
You should not give up hope
You will have a new brother
Your answer is to the point
Your dog always barks at me
Your face is familiar to me
Your name is familiar to me
Your shelf is full of books
Your soul needs to be saved
A boy came running toward me
A bright idea occurred to me
A car has one steering wheel
A dog will bark at strangers
A light lunch will be served
A small gear is missing here
A true love story never ends
Add a little sugar and cream
All of her songs became hits
All the children went to bed
All the tickets are sold out
All they had was one another
All three of us are students
All who knew him admired him
Apples are sold by the dozen
Ask me again some other time
At last he attained his goal
At least they listened to me
Be careful what you wish for
Be quiet while I am speaking
Both of his parents are well
Bring me two pieces of chalk
Cats like playing in the sun
Children need a lot of sleep
City life suits me very well
Cut the cake with that knife
Each one does what he wishes
Each state had just one vote
Everybody wanted me to do it
Fate taught me a hard lesson
Get these people out of here
Go and speak to my colleague
Go put some clean clothes on
He acted in his own interest
He adhered to his own theory
He admitted that it was true
He always does as he pleases
He always speaks well of her
He always walks with a rifle
He and I are kindred spirits
He appeared on TV last night
He asked a question about it
He asked her where she lived
He beckoned me to follow him
He begged her to forgive him
He belongs to the brass band
He brought his dog to school
He came here ten minutes ago
He came home late last night
He came to see you yesterday
He can play tennis very well
He can speak Russian as well
He collected a lot of stamps
He cut down that cherry tree
He did better than last time
He did it without me knowing
He did not enjoy his lessons
He did not have enough money
He does not have any friends
He finally bent to my wishes
He gave in to the temptation
He goes to school by bicycle
He got through with his work
He got up earlier than usual
He had a talent for painting
He had taken care of himself
He had the old machine fixed
He has a good firm handshake
He has learned to be patient
He has little money with him
He has no sense of direction
He has red hair and freckles
He helped me carry the chair
He holds the rank of colonel
He hurt himself when he fell
He is a doctor by profession
He is a lawyer by profession
He is a teacher and novelist
He is accustomed to the work
He is always late for school
He is ashamed of his failure
He is close to the president
He is deeply attached to her
He is eager to become famous
He is every inch a gentleman
He is good at playing tennis
He is more lucky than clever
He is most likely to succeed
He is no longer welcome here
He is our teacher of English
He is preparing for the test
He is present at the meeting
He is running short of funds
He is seeking a new position
He is something of an artist
He is trusted by his parents
He is very sensitive to cold
He is watching my every move
He kept all the windows open
He kissed me on the forehead
He knows a lot about animals
He knows a lot about flowers
He knows how to cheat people
He learned the poem by heart
He left school two weeks ago
He let me use his typewriter
He likes all kinds of sports
He likes walking in the park
He lived alone in the forest
He made a mistake on purpose
He made fun of our ignorance
He made me carry his baggage
He made reference to my book
He may have missed the train
He moved from place to place
He needs to follow my advice
He never goes out after dark
He never seems to grow older
He patted me on the shoulder
He played the part of Hamlet
He plays the piano very well
He presented her with a doll
He pretended to be my friend
He promised he would help us
He promised me to come early
He ran away with the diamond
He rarely goes to the movies
He refused to take the bribe
He said he knows this secret
He sat with his legs crossed
He should atone for his sins
He should have been an actor
He showed us a beautiful hat
He slipped out the back door
He sometimes comes to see me
He stared at the steep slope
He stayed out of public life
He stood with his feet apart
He stuck with his own theory
He studied the way birds fly
He tried to commit a suicide
He turned out to be innocent
He wanted to become a farmer
He wanted to test his limits
He was burning up with fever
He was innocent of the crime
He was jealous of my success
He was not a good politician
He was proud of his daughter
He was stunned by her beauty
He was surprised at the news
He was surprised by the news
He was tricked into doing it
He was unaware of the danger
He was wounded in a burglary
He was wounded in the battle
He washes the car every week
He went fishing in the river
He went hunting in the woods
He went to Tokyo on business
He went upstairs to her room
He will become a good doctor
He will leave Japan in April
He will not be back tomorrow
He will regret his own words
He wishes to become a doctor
He wondered why she did that
He worked far into the night
He works in the car industry
He would not raise my salary
He wrote a book on porcelain
Her beauty will fade in time
Her father works at the bank
Her mother is a good pianist
Her theory is based on facts
Her uncle is a famous doctor
Here is where it all happens
His jokes had us in stitches
His long speech bored us all
His nose is his best feature
His story moved her to tears
His success went to his head
Hold the box with both hands
Honesty pays in the long run
Hope you had a good birthday
I admire him for his courage
I advise you to stop smoking
I always wanted a tree house
I am amazed at your audacity
I am ashamed of your conduct
I am doubtful of his success
I am familiar with his music
I am familiar with your name
I am fond of Australian food
I am more beautiful than you
I am not acquainted with him
I am not concerned with this
I am surprised to learn this
I am taking French next year
I am thinking of my vacation
I am trying to learn English
I asked what Tom was reading
I assumed that she was there
I ate lunch in the cafeteria
I bear no grudge against you
I believe that he comes here
I belong to the sailing club
I bought a book of folktales
I bought them each a present
I bought two loaves of bread
I can never thank you enough
I can recommend it to anyone
I can speak English a little
I can speak a little English
I could not eat another bite
I dated Mary for three years
I demand that he be punished
I did better than I expected
I disapprove of what you say
I drink my tea without sugar
I enjoyed every minute of it
I feel really bad about this
I figured I had enough money
I finished all my work early
I followed him into his room
I forgot something in my car
I found the book by accident
I found the boy sound asleep
I got a little too impatient
I got slapped on both cheeks
I got the ticket for nothing
I got you a little something
I had some cash stashed away
I had something else in mind
I had such a happy childhood
I had the exact same feeling
I had to do everything alone
I have a good appetite today
I have a proposition for you
I have a slight headache now
I have a throbbing pain here
I have absolute trust in him
I have absolute trust in you
I have already read the book
I have been to London before
I have hardly any money left
I have just finished my work
I have never been to America
I have read this book before
I have seen that girl before
I have something to give you
I have something to show you
I have something to tell you
I have things to do tomorrow
I have to show you something
I have to solve this problem
I have to tell him something
I have two questions for you
I heard someone call my name
I heard you just got married
I held the umbrella over her
I hope this can help someone
I hope you enjoyed your trip
I just felt like coming home
I just got here this morning
I just had our house painted
I just had this suit cleaned
I just wanted to say goodbye
I just wanted to write songs
I knew I was making mistakes
I know very little about him
I know what you are thinking
I know who killed my parents
I know you have a girlfriend
I know your father very well
I laughed in spite of myself
I learned a lot this weekend
I left something in the room
I left you a couple messages
I lied on my job application
I like French food very much
I like meat better than fish
I live a totally normal life
I lived abroad for ten years
I love cooking for my family
I managed to find his office
I managed to finish the work
I may have hurt his feelings
I may have something for you
I may not get another chance
I mentioned your name to him
I missed school for six days
I mistook him for my brother
I moved back with my parents
I must find some new friends
I must get my watch repaired
I must have the wrong number
I need something for a child
I need something to write on
I need to finish my homework
I need to get another lawyer
I need to practice my French
I need to show you something
I never drink tea with lemon
I never heard from him again
I never learned how to write
I never said you were boring
I never saw Tom before today
I often go fishing with them
I only slept for three hours
I ordered a book from London
I promise I will protect you
I promise to come back early
I quit smoking two years ago
I rarely listen to the radio
I read this in the newspaper
I really like being with you
I really want to believe you
I received a letter from her
I relayed the message to Tom
I seem to have a temperature
I seldom listen to the radio
I sent the parcel by airmail
I slept very well last night
I study from eight to eleven
I suggest we take the stairs
I tanned myself on the beach
I think Tom stole my bicycle
I think she will divorce him
I think we both should leave
I think we found the problem
I think we should follow Tom
I think you have my umbrella
I think you must be mistaken
I think you should leave now
I thought I had enough money
I thought I heard your voice
I thought Tom would say that
I thought it might be useful
I thought that he was honest
I thought we could do better
I thought you could use this
I thought you might be upset
I thought you read my resume
I thought you wanted to wait
I thought you were in charge
I thought you were my friend
I thought you would say that
I told you everything I knew
I trusted him with the money
I waited more than two hours
I want another cup of coffee
I want exactly what you want
I want ice cream for dessert
I want my room painted white
I want something good to eat
I want something to write on
I want the work done quickly
I want time instead of money
I want to convey my sympathy
I want to deposit some money
I want to eat something good
I want to show you something
I want to travel by airplane
I want to try something else
I wanted to make new friends
I wanted to work this summer
I was aching from the injury
I was alone in the classroom
I was ashamed of my behavior
I was aware of being watched
I was disappointed in my son
I was home all day yesterday
I was just leaving home then
I was laughed at by everyone
I was only saying my prayers
I was outraged by his answer
I was too surprised to speak
I was very worried about her
I wash my face every morning
I went swimming in the river
I went there dozens of times
I went to donate blood today
I went to the park yesterday
I will deal with them myself
I will never have a daughter
I will quit smoking for good
I will speak to you tomorrow
I wish I could speak English
I wish I had eaten breakfast
I wish it would stop raining
I woke up early this morning
I work as a museum attendant
I worked hard for this money
I worked really hard on this
I would do anything but that
I would like to study Arabic
I would like to travel alone
I would not go skating today
I would rather have a coffee
It all happened kind of fast
It appears that he is honest
It can be confusing at first
It is dangerous to swim here
It must have slipped my mind
It rained hard all day today
It sounds very strange to me
It was a beautiful sunny day
It was a calm winter evening
It was a warm summer evening
It was all covered with dust
It was dark under the bridge
It was harder than I thought
It was just a stupid mistake
It was nice meeting you here
Just give me one more chance
Keep an eye on this suitcase
Keep that thing away from me
Keep your hands on the wheel
Kyoto has many places to see
Learn to walk before you run
Let me save you some trouble
Look at the cloud over there
Make a circle and hold hands
Mary is knitting Tom a scarf
Mary is studying in her room
Mary likes both Tom and John
Mary said Tom was in trouble
Maybe we should go to Boston
Maybe we should just give up
Meat should not be eaten raw
Mom and Dad are very nervous
Money does not grow on trees
Most of her friends are boys
Most of my friends are girls
My aunt died an old spinster
My boss was forced to resign
My brother has a good memory
My car is now being repaired
My car was stolen last night
My cousin is hooked on smack
My father is fifty years old
My father works in a factory
My friend called me a coward
My hard drive is almost full
My house is five blocks away
My house is near the station
My life is empty without him
My sister is in her twenties
My sister is younger than me
My watch is ten minutes fast
My watch is ten minutes slow
My wife is cooking right now
Never give up on your dreams
No man can serve two masters
No one could find the answer
No one was absent except her
No student went to the party
Nobody backed up what I said
Nobody can keep us apart now
Nobody forced you to help me
Nobody thinks this is a joke
Nobody told me you were here
None of these eggs are fresh
None of this makes any sense
Nothing is new under the sun
Old habits are hard to break
One of the lions has escaped
Our garden was full of weeds
Our little boy is growing up
Our mother bought us a puppy
Our team is two points ahead
Our team lost the first game
Perhaps you should buy a gun
Please come and see me again
Please find out where she is
Please go on with your story
Please let in some fresh air
Please send the book by mail
Please wait here for a while
Please write down what I say
Put an icepack on your cheek
Put some water into the vase
Read the article on page two
Rice gruel is easy to digest
Roulette is a game of chance
Rules are meant to be broken
Sawako wants to go to France
Say which one you would like
She advised him not to smoke
She advised me where to stay
She asked him for some money
She asked him where he lived
She asked me about my mother
She brought him to our place
She came home in low spirits
She came to see us yesterday
She caught a cold last night
She clearly does not mean it
She dressed up for the party
She gave birth to twin girls
She gave me her phone number
She gave me some good advice
She gets along well with him
She gets prettier day by day
She got married in her teens
She has a bath every morning
She has an advantage over me
She has been to England once
She has lived alone for ages
She has never fallen in love
She has never seen it before
She invited him to her party
She invited me to the ballet
She is a most beautiful lady
She is a second year student
She is absorbed in her study
She is envious of my success
She is good at imitating him
She is more wise than clever
She is never late for school
She is on the teaching staff
She is proud of her children
She is proud of her daughter
She is proud of her students
She is rather poor at tennis
She is really in good health
She is trying to lose weight
She is very bitter toward me
She is working night and day
She kept crying all the time
She left the last page blank
She likes to listen to music
She lives on a small pension
She looked at me and laughed
She looked up at the ceiling
She made him a simple dinner
She made jam from the apples
She mistook me for my sister
She needs to be more careful
She passed away two days ago
She pleaded with him to stay
She pretended not to hear me
She rides her bike to school
She saw a tall man yesterday
She saw him break the window
She seems to have been happy
She slipped her arm into his
She squeezed a lemon for tea
She suggested that he try it
She thanked him for his help
She took part in the contest
She tried on the party dress
She waited for him for hours
She was absorbed in her work
She was barred from the club
She was deceived by a friend
She was dressed all in black
She was hurt in the accident
She was on verge of fainting
She was present at the party
She was sitting under a tree
She was talking all the time
She was there in the morning
She was too shocked to speak
She will be here before long
She writes to him every week
Smith died of a heart attack
Some of the money was stolen
Some of these apples are bad
Sometimes I run out of money
Stop acting like such a fool
Stop staring at me like that
Stop talking to me about Tom
Strike while the iron is hot
Such a person is seldom dull
Tell me again where you live
Thank you all for being here
Thank you for helping me out
That article is out of stock
That baby is fat and healthy
That bridge is made of stone
That bullet was meant for me
That car belongs in a museum
That comes to the same thing
That dress looks good on you
That guy gives me the creeps
That has fallen out of style
That is a very good question
That is no business of yours
That message was sent by Tom
That never used to bother me
That reminds me of my father
That sounds like a good deal
That sounds like a good idea
That textbook is out of date
That tie suits you very well
The apple fell from the tree
The baby was quiet all night
The bank is closed on Sunday
The bear was eating an apple
The bike screeched to a stop
The boy looked into the room
The bucket was full of water
The car is waxed and shining
The car ran into a guardrail
The cat was licking its paws
The cats are afraid of water
The cliff hangs over the sea
The cost of living has risen
The door could not be opened
The dress fits you very well
The early bird gets the worm
The elevator is out of order
The floor must be kept clean
The floor must be very clean
The girl caught a small fish
The girls bought him a watch
The lawn needs to be watered
The leaves fell to the earth
The letter was signed by Tom
The main valve is turned off
The man was a total stranger
The meeting is ten days away
The meeting was all but over
The nurse hit a blood vessel
The old man died from hunger
The old man has enough money
The old man starved to death
The pasture is full of weeds
The plate is made of plastic
The reason for this is plain
The road is jammed with cars
The roof leaks when it rains
The ship set sail for Bombay
The shop is closed on Sunday
The sky was bright and clear
The story had a happy ending
The stream is not very swift
The sun gives light and heat
The sun rises in the morning
The thieves hid in the woods
The time for talking is over
The traffic ground to a halt
The train left two hours ago
The tree fell down by itself
The trees were full of birds
The truth shall set you free
The two men were not related
The wall is two meters thick
The word is unfamiliar to me
The work is not finished yet
The wound has not healed yet
The young guy wants to drink
There are holes in the floor
There are only two days left
There is a full moon tonight
There is nothing like a walk
There is only one bath towel
There was a church here once
These hats are the same size
They are much taller than us
They are not my real parents
They are running in the park
They assigned the task to us
They began to climb the hill
They bought a box of cookies
They closed the shop at five
They come from the same town
They crawled out of the cave
They did not keep their word
They did what they were told
They forgot to lock the door
They have to be very careful
They invited me to the party
They just taught me to swear
They left it under the table
They live on the floor below
They received a box of books
They tried to swim to safety
They wanted to steal the car
They worshiped him as a hero
Things are about to get ugly
This book sold well in Japan
This car has a good warranty
This chair needs to be fixed
This door leads to the study
This dress fits me very well
This dress is a good bargain
This dress looks good on you
This fashion has had its day
This hall was full of people
This is a book about England
This is a kind of watermelon
This is a very good question
This is a very rare specimen
This is a very serious issue
This is going to be fabulous
This is not a dating website
This is the very best method
This is very important to us
This is where it all happens
This is where the fun begins
This may be your last chance
This museum is worth a visit
This photo was taken in Nara
This road leads to Hong Kong
This road leads to the river
This sounds like a good idea
This watch is a real bargain
This water is a little salty
This will help keep you warm
This will only take a second
This young couple is in love
Time has come to get serious
Today I have a good appetite
Today is a very exciting day
Tom and I work well together
Tom and Mary are still young
Tom and Mary are very hungry
Tom asked Mary for some help
Tom ate all of the chocolate
Tom began to brush his teeth
Tom bought a house in Boston
Tom can do anything he wants
Tom comes from a good family
Tom decided to go home early
Tom decided to take a chance
Tom died on Monday in Boston
Tom eats less than Mary does
Tom got stung by a jellyfish
Tom has a healthy life style
Tom has a very stressful job
Tom has done it enough times
Tom has more books than Mary
Tom has never had much money
Tom has no problem with that
Tom helped Mary dye her hair
Tom is a high school student
Tom is a very strange person
Tom is back in his apartment
Tom is having a heart attack
Tom is listening to his iPod
Tom is much fatter than Mary
Tom is not my friend anymore
Tom is only thirty years old
Tom is still in the bathroom
Tom is swimming in the river
Tom is taking his final exam
Tom is very afraid of snakes
Tom jumped out of the window
Tom kissed Mary on the cheek
Tom knew that Mary loved him
Tom knew there was a problem
Tom leaned down to kiss Mary
Tom likes to climb the trees
Tom looked out of the window
Tom may do whatever he wants
Tom needs to be more careful
Tom never knew Mary was rich
Tom never really got over it
Tom often stays up all night
Tom ought to stop doing that
Tom poured milk into the cup
Tom reads the New York Times
Tom refused to pay his bills
Tom refused to sign his name
Tom rushed out of his office
Tom said he enjoyed the show
Tom said that he was thirsty
Tom sat at the kitchen table
Tom says that he detests war
Tom sent Mary a text message
Tom should do what Mary says
Tom sold his house in Boston
Tom thought Mary could do it
Tom told Mary to stop eating
Tom waited more than an hour
Tom wanted to see Mary happy
Tom wanted to stop and think
Tom wanted to tell the truth
Tom wanted to wash his hands
Tom wants to become a priest
Tom wants to go to Australia
Tom was dressed all in black
Tom was hiding behind a tree
Tom was in Boston last month
Tom was stabbed in the chest
Tom was wearing a brown coat
Tom went back to his bedroom
Tom went into the room first
Tom went to church with Mary
Tom went with Mary to Boston
Tom will make a good teacher
Tom will never agree to that
Too many sweets make you fat
Turn left at the first light
Turn left at the next corner
Turn the radio down a little
Twenty people died in a fire
Two cars were in an accident
Variety is the spice of life
Visiting Tom was a good idea
Wait here till he comes back
We all need to stay together
We all need to work together
We are liable for the damage
We are not going on vacation
We booked seats for the play
We both know Tom is innocent
We can rely on his judgement
We crossed the river by boat
We found all the boxes empty
We found the boy fast asleep
We got caught in a rainstorm
We had better not mention it
We have a colleague in Spain
We have little time to waste
We lead a very ordinary life
We listened to the bell ring
We live close to the station
We live far from the airport
We live in the United States
We must conform to the rules
We must keep our hands clean
We need more people like Tom
We need to water the flowers
We saw smoke in the distance
We should do this more often
We should tell Tom the truth
We still have plenty of time
We talked about it all night
We took shelter under a tree
We walked ten miles that day
We went on a picnic together
We were up all night talking
We will be living in England
We work every day but Sunday
We work from dawn until dusk
What Tom did was very stupid
What she said made him angry
Whoever wants it may take it
Winds from the sea are humid
Winds from the sea are moist
You always were good at math
You and I are going together
You are both pretty and kind
You are suitable for the job
You can be anything you want
You can do whatever you like
You can easily find the bank
You can go anyplace you like
You can go anywhere you like
You can go wherever you want
You gave me only fifty cents
You had better start at once
You have blood on your hands
You have good taste in music
You have to accept your role
You look just like my sister
You may choose what you like
You may go anywhere you like
You might be late for school
You must allow for his youth
You must not leave right now
You must realize that by now
You must think this is funny
You need to accept your role
You need to do more research
You need to press the button
You remind me of my daughter
You remind me of your father
You remind me of your mother
You said you figured out why
You said you wanted a family
You should do that right now
You should get your hair cut
You should look that word up
You should look this word up
You should look up that word
You should look up this word
You should not speak so loud
Your cat is driving me crazy
Your hands need to be washed
Your idea is similar to mine
Your pen is better than mine
Youth is wasted on the young
A boy came running towards me
A burnt child dreads the fire
A crowd gathered at the scene
A face appeared at the window
A good citizen obeys the laws
A good many people were there
A new oil tanker was launched
A new year always brings hope
A number of books were stolen
A square has four equal sides
A unicycle has only one wheel
All of them are good teachers
All our attempts were in vain
All that glitters is not gold
All the guests have gone home
All the sails were taken down
Answer at once when spoken to
Any house is better than none
Anyone can write his own name
Ask if he wants another drink
Attach labels to all the bags
Be careful about what you eat
Bird watching is a nice hobby
Both of the brothers are dead
Boys can be trained to behave
Bread and milk are good foods
Call me if you find something
Close the door when you leave
Come home before it gets dark
Do not turn off your computer
Do whatever you want about it
Doctors thought he had a cold
Dry the pants on the radiator
Each student has his own desk
Empty the purse into this bag
England is proud of her poets
Every little boy needs a hero
Everyone is going to be there
Everyone is very proud of you
Few people live on the island
France was at war with Russia
Fruit tends to rot right away
Give me something to write on
Give me three pieces of chalk
Greek is not an easy language
Half of the apples are rotten
Half of the melons were eaten
Hang that picture on the wall
He admitted that he was wrong
He always says the same thing
He always sings in the shower
He asked a very good question
He asked his friends for help
He behaved himself like a man
He behaved like he was afraid
He belongs to our tennis team
He belongs to the upper class
He blamed me for the accident
He bought me a new dictionary
He came back after many years
He came in through the window
He can speak Chinese a little
He can speak a little English
He could do nothing but watch
He could not believe his ears
He could not walk any further
He deserves to know the truth
He does not study hard enough
He dozed off in history class
He dried himself with a towel
He earns twenty dollars a day
He encouraged me to try again
He explained the matter to me
He filled the glass with wine
He gave me a penetrating gaze
He had been walking for hours
He has a fairly large fortune
He has a heated swimming pool
He has a lot of acquaintances
He has a short attention span
He has a very expensive watch
He has never cleaned his room
He hurried to catch the train
He is a dentist by profession
He is accustomed to hard work
He is acquainted with my wife
He is afraid of becoming sick
He is ashamed of his behavior
He is better than anyone else
He is devoid of human feeling
He is earning twice my salary
He is generous to his friends
He is generous with his money
He is lying through his teeth
He is proud of his collection
He is something of a musician
He is taller than his brother
He is used to making speeches
He is used to such situations
He just loves to bully people
He keeps his youth by jogging
He knocked on the closed door
He lived there all by himself
He lives in a gated community
He lives in an enormous house
He looks just like his father
He looks just like his mother
He loves going to the theater
He never saw his father again
He never saw his mother again
He never saw his sister again
He often eats fish for dinner
He paused to have a cigarette
He played tennis all day long
He plays the guitar very well
He plays the violin very well
He quickly runs out of breath
He revealed the secret to her
He sat listening to the radio
He seems absorbed in his work
He sees nothing wrong with it
He shook hands with the mayor
He showed up late to practice
He slept with the window open
He smoked a cigar after lunch
He stiffed me for fifty bucks
He takes a walk every morning
He thinks that she will leave
He thought of a good solution
He told me about the accident
He wanted to please the crowd
He wants to marry my daughter
He was a disagreeable old man
He was accused of evading tax
He was attracted to the woman
He was aware of being watched
He was better than I expected
He was busy with his homework
He was found guilty of murder
He was heard singing the song
He was jogging down the beach
He was playing tennis all day
He was present at the meeting
He was seen crossing the road
He was willing to help others
He will succeed to the throne
He worked long into the night
He works every day but Sunday
He would not follow my advice
He wrapped his arms around me
He wrote down all the details
Her eyes were full of sadness
Her eyes were red from crying
Her house is across the river
Her idea is better than yours
Her oldest son is not married
Her son will succeed for sure
Her watch is ten minutes slow
Here are some letters for you
His car collided with a train
His death was partly my fault
His essay is better than mine
His face was covered with mud
His girlfriend did it for him
His house is across from mine
His mother was ashamed of him
His oldest son is not married
His room is anything but neat
His uncle died five years ago
His watch is ten minutes slow
His way of speaking annoys me
Hold the ball with both hands
Hold the vase with both hands
I accompanied him on the trip
I admire you for your courage
I agree with most people here
I almost bought that same tie
I always feel blue on Mondays
I am afraid of having trouble
I am anxious about his health
I am blessed with good health
I am completely out of breath
I am concerned for her safety
I am disappointed at the news
I am engaged in AIDS research
I am going abroad this summer
I am going out this afternoon
I am happy with my girlfriend
I am looking for an assistant
I am making too many mistakes
I am seeing my uncle tomorrow
I am singing with my children
I am thinking of going abroad
I am very interested in music
I am well acquainted with him
I apologize if I offended you
I arrived ahead of the others
I believe in getting up early
I believe that he is innocent
I belong to the baseball team
I belong to the swimming club
I blamed him for the accident
I borrowed this book from him
I bought a new sewing machine
I bought some cheese and milk
I broke up with my girlfriend
I brush my teeth after eating
I called him to the telephone
I called in sick this morning
I can eat anything but onions
I can no longer remain silent
I can recommend a good lawyer
I can respond to his question
I can scarcely sleep at night
I caught a big fish yesterday
I consider him a great writer
I could use a little sympathy
I did it without any problems
I do my homework after school
I dream about you every night
I dream about you quite often
I dream of becoming a teacher
I enjoy watching soccer on TV
I excused myself for a minute
I expected that he would come
I feel very lonely these days
I felt myself being lifted up
I felt sure this would happen
I figured you might want this
I get nauseous whenever I fly
I go shopping every other day
I guess my mind just wandered
I had a conversation with Tom
I hate those kinds of answers
I have a serious skin problem
I have neither time nor money
I have nothing further to say
I have only five thousand yen
I have some cash stashed away
I have something else in mind
I have to tighten these bolts
I hope Tom feels better today
I hope that it rains tomorrow
I hope things will get better
I hope your brother is better
I informed her of his arrival
I informed him of her arrival
I just cleaned all the tables
I just had the weirdest dream
I just thought you were happy
I just want everybody to live
I just wanted to clarify that
I knew they were your friends
I knew this moment would come
I know that you feel helpless
I know what they are thinking
I know your brother very well
I know your feelings are hurt
I learned to live without her
I left earlier than my sister
I like coffee better than tea
I like spending time with her
I like spending time with you
I look forward to my birthday
I love him despite his faults
I love spending time with you
I love the taste of mushrooms
I love you more than anything
I loved working here with you
I made him carry the suitcase
I met her on campus yesterday
I mistook Tom for his brother
I mistook him for his brother
I must finish this work first
I must have my watch repaired
I nearly choked on a fishbone
I need to make an appointment
I needed time to convince her
I never learned his real name
I never liked that one anyway
I never wanted to hurt anyone
I noticed that he had stopped
I often go downtown on Sunday
I often play tennis on Sunday
I often went fishing with him
I once worked in a restaurant
I only did what was necessary
I painted the roof light blue
I played catch with my father
I promised not to tell anyone
I quit smoking six months ago
I ran ahead to warn everybody
I really need to hit somebody
I really think I should drive
I really think we should talk
I recommended Tom for the job
I relaxed at home last Sunday
I saw him crossing the street
I saw the match on television
I see nothing wrong with this
I should have taken the money
I should have told you before
I spent my vacation in Hakone
I stayed there for three days
I suggested that she go alone
I take care of my grandfather
I thank you for your courtesy
I think I did something wrong
I think you should choose Tom
I thought Tom was from Boston
I thought Tom was your friend
I thought Tom would be hungry
I thought that you could swim
I thought we already did that
I thought we had an agreement
I thought you already had one
I thought you did fairly well
I thought you might need help
I thought you were a Canadian
I told everyone to be careful
I took part in the discussion
I tossed and turned all night
I use Google almost every day
I used to weigh seventy kilos
I want a money back guarantee
I want something hot to drink
I want something sweet to eat
I want something to drink now
I want to be more independent
I want to do something useful
I want to eat Chinese noodles
I want to see the countryside
I want to see your supervisor
I want to teach you something
I was forced to take medicine
I was impressed with her work
I was involved in the quarrel
I was looking forward to this
I was never worried about you
I was not feeling very hungry
I was often seized by despair
I was planning on telling you
I was thinking about the plan
I was thinking of getting one
I was too astonished to speak
I was trying to be supportive
I was wearing my best clothes
I went camping with my family
I went shopping in town today
I went shopping with a friend
I went there out of curiosity
I will come earlier next time
I will have to study tomorrow
I will say something about it
I will show you some pictures
I will telephone you later on
I wonder if this really works
I wonder what happened to her
I wonder who can swim fastest
I work for a shipping company
I wrote down his phone number
It all depends on the weather
It already has taken me hours
It happened to someone I know
It has never been done before
It is raining worse than ever
It is twenty minutes past ten
It looks like we have company
It rained for hours and hours
It reminds me of my childhood
It was a quiet winter evening
It was blowing hard all night
It was cheaper than I thought
It was everything I hoped for
It was not a complete victory
It was really cold on Tuesday
It was very cold this morning
It was yesterday that he died
It will be winter before long
It will get warmer and warmer
Just put yourself in my shoes
Kabuki is an old Japanese art
Keep to the left when driving
Let me tell you all something
Let me write down the address
Liars must have a good memory
Look at that koala over there
Look it up in your dictionary
Love makes the world go round
Loving is the essence of life
Many trees are bare in winter
Maybe Tom has had an accident
Maybe it was just a nightmare
Maybe you should go to Boston
Men and women need each other
Men can not exist without air
Most of his friends are girls
Most of the shops were closed
My bike was stolen last night
My boss made me work overtime
My business is slow right now
My credit cards are maxed out
My eyes get tired very easily
My father bought me a bicycle
My father does not like music
My father has gone to America
My friend lives in this house
My grade is above the average
My hands and legs are swollen
My mother likes tea very much
My mother never gets up early
My sister is shorter than you
My watch is five minutes slow
My watch keeps very good time
My whole family is doing well
My wisdom teeth are coming in
My wish has finally come true
Natural food will do you good
Never forget to lock the door
No one can escape growing old
No one could solve the puzzle
No one seems to smile anymore
No one uses that word anymore
Nobody in the world wants war
Nobody wants to work with you
None of the windows were open
Not all baby animals are cute
Nothing is the matter with me
One in ten people have myopia
One of the windows was broken
One of them is probably lying
Our bus collided with a truck
Our former home was in Sweden
Our little girl is growing up
Our school is fifty years old
Our teacher likes his new car
Our team is five points ahead
Pay attention to what he says
Pencils are sold by the dozen
People have to obey the rules
People say that life is short
People used to travel on foot
Please bring me a clean knife
Please explain the rule to me
Please feed the dog every day
Please go on with your dinner
Please help me take this down
Please hold the line a moment
Please keep it under your hat
Please say hello to your wife
Please sit down on this chair
Please wait until I come back
Prices will continue to go up
Put the desk against the wall
Reflect on what you have done
Remind him to come home early
Run and hide in the mountains
She advised him to save money
She advised him where to stay
She appears to have been rich
She beckoned me into the room
She cared for her sick father
She crouched down by the gate
She decided to resign her job
She died before coming of age
She endured to the bitter end
She forced him to eat spinach
She gave in to the temptation
She gave me a meaningful look
She gave me a wonderful smile
She has a daughter named Mary
She has a son everybody loves
She has always lived in Otaru
She has been blind from birth
She has never danced with him
She hired him as a programmer
She introduced the lady to me
She is a good English speaker
She is afraid of barking dogs
She is devoted to her husband
She is doing her homework now
She is fond of playing tennis
She is giving a party tonight
She is good at playing tennis
She is married to a foreigner
She is married to an American
She is not afraid of anything
She is paralyzed in both legs
She is pleased with the dress
She is taller than her sister
She is working on the problem
She kept smiling all the time
She laid herself on the grass
She laughed so hard she cried
She laughed to cover her fear
She left home ten minutes ago
She likes talking best of all
She looked at him with hatred
She looked at me in amusement
She lost interest in her work
She married him for his money
She may have missed the train
She may not like his attitude
She mistook me for my brother
She mistook my brother for me
She nursed him back to health
She patted me on the shoulder
She plays the piano every day
She plays the piano very well
She pointed her finger at him
She pretended to be a student
She pushed him out the window
She refused to take the money
She reminds him of his mother
She revealed her secret to us
She runs fastest in our class
She saw him eating a sandwich
She says she is seeing things
She shouted that she was safe
She showed us a beautiful hat
She stared at him with hatred
She stayed there for a moment
She surprised him with a kiss
She takes care of my children
She thought for a few minutes
She tore his letter to pieces
She tore the letter to pieces
She tried to conceal the fact
She urged him to study harder
She visits us every other day
She volunteered to do the job
She waits tables for a living
She wanted him to stay longer
She wants to attend the party
She was absorbed in the video
She was beautiful in her time
She was engrossed in her work
She was in America last month
She was merely stating a fact
She was pleased with the gift
She was sick in bed yesterday
She was surprised at the news
She was wearing a strange hat
She was wearing an ugly dress
She went to Mexico by herself
She will be here this evening
She would not change her mind
She writes with her left hand
Some of the crew were drowned
Some people have all the luck
Some words are hard to define
Somebody caught me by the arm
Sport is good for your health
Spring fever is not a disease
Stop talking and listen to me
Summers are very hot in Kyoto
Tell me about your daily life
Tell the truth no matter what
Thank you for listening to me
Thank you for your kind words
That book is full of mistakes
That boy speaks like an adult
That building must be on fire
That does make me feel better
That dress is perfect for you
That happened over a year ago
That he loved her was certain
That house is built of bricks
That leaves no room for doubt
That man has a bad reputation
That may be an important clue
That movie star has many fans
That pretty girl is my sister
That should be enough for you
That sounds like a great idea
That sounds like a great plan
The airplane took off on time
The almond trees are in bloom
The apples are not quite ripe
The argument ended in a fight
The army forced him to resign
The barber gave him a haircut
The basket was full of apples
The boy was sold into slavery
The bus was two minutes early
The candle went out by itself
The capital of Japan is Tokyo
The car crashed into the wall
The cat crept toward the bird
The children went out to play
The climate is moist and warm
The clock has just struck ten
The clock is ten minutes slow
The cloth was dyed bright red
The coach gave me some advice
The concert is about to start
The decision is not yet final
The desk is covered with dust
The dictionary is on the desk
The earth goes around the sun
The first step is the hardest
The food was better in prison
The garden needs to be weeded
The girl did not say anything
The homework is due next week
The house appears to be empty
The house is not occupied now
The kids are driving me crazy
The king always wears a crown
The letter was written by Tom
The light is better over here
The money is at your disposal
The moon is behind the clouds
The noise set the dog barking
The novel is worthy of praise
The old man has missing teeth
The pain has mostly gone away
The park is open to everybody
The plan is not yet finalized
The police broke up the crowd
The result remains to be seen
The rich are not always happy
The road was clear of traffic
The robber bashed her head in
The robot went out of control
The room is covered with dust
The sample is not pure enough
The shoes are made of leather
The shy boy murmured his name
The summer here is quite warm
The sun is the brightest star
The sun shines during the day
The town was full of activity
The train has not arrived yet
The train is bound for London
The train was delayed by snow
The troops had plenty of arms
The twins are very much alike
The two women know each other
The vase was broken to pieces
The war had lasted four years
The whole class took the test
The wind is blowing very hard
There are cookies in the oven
There are rats in the kitchen
There are statues in the park
There is no shortage of ideas
There is snow on the mountain
There were no more free seats
There were two pieces of cake
They all joined in the chorus
They all laughed at his error
They all laughed at his jokes
They belong to the chess club
They cleared the road of snow
They did not have enough gold
They have to repair their car
They invited me to play cards
They kept their love a secret
They might be taller than you
They refused to join the army
They showed it to our company
They started at the same time
They stayed at a luxury hotel
They waited for him for hours
They were free at that moment
Things are not what they seem
Things did not go as intended
This book is full of mistakes
This book sells well in Japan
This box is made of cardboard
This bridge is built of stone
This chimney is made of brick
This clock seems to be broken
This coffee is not hot enough
This device may come in handy
This girl is driving me crazy
This is a recipe for disaster
This is an option to consider
This is exactly what I needed
This is how I learned English
This is my natural hair color
This is where my father works
This is worth one million yen
This job is beyond my ability
This knife has served me well
This movie is for adults only
This problem is hard to solve
This road needs to be repaved
This ship was ten meters long
This shirt needs to be washed
This stays between you and me
This story has a happy ending
This tastes pretty good to me
This train is bound for Tokyo
This tree does not bear fruit
This was built since long ago
This work is difficult for us
Tokyo is the capital of Japan
Tom and Mary decided to leave
Tom and Mary grew up together
Tom began to worry about Mary
Tom bought a present for Mary
Tom bought a very good camera
Tom came here to study French
Tom continued to talk to Mary
Tom decided to enter the room
Tom died from a drug overdose
Tom does nothing but watch TV
Tom dozed off in French class
Tom followed me to the garage
Tom found me a French teacher
Tom goes to school by bicycle
Tom greeted Mary with a smile
Tom has a heavy German accent
Tom has already gone to sleep
Tom has never seen Mary dance
Tom has something in his hand
Tom has something to tell you
Tom hates being told to hurry
Tom is a very creative person
Tom is playing the violin now
Tom is reading in his bedroom
Tom is taller than his mother
Tom is trying to learn French
Tom is waiting at the airport
Tom kept his illness a secret
Tom knew Mary had kissed John
Tom knew he was being watched
Tom knocked on the front door
Tom knows what the problem is
Tom lives and works in Boston
Tom looked at it more closely
Tom looked closer at the food
Tom mistook me for my brother
Tom needs a change of scenery
Tom opened the window a crack
Tom plays organ at our church
Tom poured milk on his cereal
Tom said that he was innocent
Tom sang better than Mary did
Tom saw Mary break the window
Tom saw Mary trying to escape
Tom says that he never dreams
Tom screamed to Mary for help
Tom screwed in the light bulb
Tom seldom goes out on Monday
Tom sent Mary a birthday card
Tom should be here any minute
Tom showed me his photo album
Tom showed us his photo album
Tom sometimes comes to see me
Tom spent thirty days in jail
Tom taught himself how to ski
Tom took a lot of photographs
Tom walked to the parking lot
Tom wanted me to learn French
Tom wanted to become a lawyer
Tom wanted to dance with Mary
Tom wanted to make more money
Tom wants to apologize to you
Tom wants to become a fireman
Tom wants to become a teacher
Tom was a very tough opponent
Tom went back into his office
Tom went down to the basement
Tom went home for the weekend
Tom won the contest last year
Tom would make a good teacher
Trees do not grow on prairies
Turn right at the next corner
Two heads are better than one
We admire her for her bravery
We are listening to the radio
We are looking for each other
We both have the same problem
We can see many stars tonight
We could all be dead tomorrow
We found the boy sound asleep
We had a fire drill yesterday
We had a very vigorous debate
We had better call the police
We have a good heating system
We have achieved all our aims
We have made friends with Tom
We have things all worked out
We have to ask everybody this
We have to solve this problem
We hope you enjoyed your stay
We know each other quite well
We met at the designated spot
We might have frost next week
We must cut down our expenses
We must do away with violence
We must not break our promise
We need more doctors like you
We need to be more aggressive
We need to get something done
We need to know what happened
We never speak French at home
We often play cards on Sunday
We plan to go hiking tomorrow
We played many kinds of games
We really had nothing to lose
We relaxed in the living room
We saw another ship far ahead
We should be better than this
We should get along just fine
We should take a coffee break
We sometimes swim in the lake
We spent hours looking for it
We thought he was an American
We took turns driving the car
We usually sleep in this room
We want to solve that problem
We went swimming at the beach
We went to the beach together
We were caught in a snowstorm
We were children at that time
We were proud of our strength
We wish you a pleasant flight
Weeds sprang up in the garden
Wet clothes cling to the body
What you were taught is wrong
You are nothing but a student
You can borrow my car anytime
You can eat whatever you like
You can say whatever you want
You had better see the doctor
You have a pretty good memory
You have done a wonderful job
You have to obey your parents
You knew the answer all along
You look good in this picture
You make it sound very simple
You must have seen them there
You must know Tom pretty well
You must look after the child
You must not behave like this
You must pay attention to him
You must think of your family
You must work hard to succeed
You need to save the princess
You never could keep a secret
You probably just have a cold
You remind me of your brother
You said you wanted the truth
You seem a million miles away
You seem pretty calm about it
You should ask Tom for advice
You should do that right away
You should stay at home today
You should tell him the truth
You should try the exam again
You were just doing your duty
You will need an armed escort
You would make a great mother
Your bike is better than mine
Your new dress is very pretty
Your parents ought to know it
Your story is hard to believe
Your team is better than ours
A bad habit is easily acquired
A bad smell permeated the room
A century is one hundred years
A fallen tree blocked the path
A great future lies before her
A map helps us study geography
A pretty waitress waited on us
A strange feeling came over me
A thick fog delayed our flight
All Tom does nowadays is study
All of them were wearing black
All the parking lots were full
All the players did their best
All the stones have been moved
All their efforts were in vain
All you do is criticize others
An elephant is a strong animal
Be careful not to cut yourself
Be careful with what you drink
Bee stings can be very painful
Beer bottles are made of glass
Bees fly from flower to flower
Birds learn to fly by instinct
Blood poured from the cut vein
Both Tom and Mary are teachers
Both of my sisters are married
Business is so slow these days
Choose either one or the other
Count the apples in the basket
Deposit your money in the bank
Do not say such foolish things
Do whatever you think is right
Each child was given a present
Even Tom is a little surprised
Every nation has its own myths
Everyone in my family is happy
Everyone said that I was wrong
Everyone wanted to talk to Tom
Father bought me a new bicycle
Feel free to ask any questions
Few girls were late for school
Few people came to the lecture
Few people know about the plan
Flying a kite can be dangerous
French is the language of love
Give me three pieces of salmon
Give my regards to your family
He admitted that he was guilty
He advised us against doing it
He always leaves home at seven
He always wears his school tie
He and I are childhood friends
He arrived after the bell rang
He asked his friend for advice
He aspires to become a teacher
He became a handsome young man
He became more and more famous
He bought his daughter a dress
He broke the window on purpose
He came to my office yesterday
He can scarcely write his name
He combined two ideas into one
He comes here almost every day
He could not control his anger
He could not speak French well
He dedicated his life to peace
He denied having written to me
He did not accept my apologies
He did not understand her joke
He drank three bottles of beer
He earns his living by writing
He entered the room on tiptoes
He felt his heart beating fast
He gorged himself on ice cream
He has a very interesting book
He has no chance of recovering
He has no interest in politics
He helped me carry the baggage
He introduced his sister to me
He is a very thoughtful person
He is absent from school today
He is actually not the manager
He is anything but a gentleman
He is ashamed to ask questions
He is clever at making excuses
He is confident of his ability
He is enjoying his school life
He is not studying English now
He is often absent from school
He is something of a celebrity
He is working in AIDS research
He kept silent during the meal
He learned how to raise cattle
He left soon after our arrival
He likes to sing popular songs
He likes to talk about himself
He lived abroad for many years
He lives alone in an apartment
He lives on his country estate
He looks nothing like a doctor
He looks older than my brother
He made no effort to apologize
He majored in drama at college
He misses his family very much
He moved back with his parents
He must have entered this room
He never gave in to temptation
He never saw his brother again
He often drives to the library
He painted all the walls green
He painted the door over white
He pressed me against the wall
He promised to write every day
He quietly knocked at the door
He rarely stays home on Sunday
He reached the rank of general
He rescued a boy from drowning
He said he would call tomorrow
He said something to my friend
He seldom writes to his father
He sent his luggage in advance
He shook hands with his friend
He started to study in earnest
He studied the flight of birds
He thinks his job is pointless
He thinks only of making money
He took charge of the expenses
He took the public by surprise
He tossed and turned all night
He tried to gain her affection
He tried to restrain his anger
He tried writing a short story
He uses honey instead of sugar
He walks his dog every morning
He was absent from the meeting
He was accompanied by his wife
He was angry with his daughter
He was beside himself with joy
He was called away on business
He was delighted at the result
He was deserted by his friends
He was determined to go abroad
He was exposed to many dangers
He was injured in the accident
He was involved in the trouble
He was punished for his crimes
He was sleeping under the tree
He was surprised to learn this
He was wounded in the shoulder
He went home three hours later
He will notice sooner or later
He works from Monday to Friday
He wrapped his arms around her
He writes scripts for TV shows
Her daughter is bad at cooking
Her father has a general store
Her hair is long and beautiful
His absence was due to illness
His behavior is very odd today
His car has just been repaired
His clothes are out of fashion
His doctor ordered him to rest
His family works in the fields
His new novel is worth reading
His report does not sound true
His room was covered with dust
His sudden death was a tragedy
His voice dropped to a whisper
Hold on firmly to the handrail
I accompanied her on the piano
I advise you to change clothes
I almost forgot all about that
I already did that twice today
I always have room for dessert
I always root for the underdog
I always thought Tom was funny
I am anxious about your health
I am learning a little English
I am not wearing any underwear
I am terribly afraid of snakes
I am very interested in French
I apologize for the late reply
I asked him about the accident
I believe you have my umbrella
I bought a dozen pencils today
I bought these flowers for you
I bought two pairs of trousers
I can hardly believe his story
I can not answer your question
I can think of several reasons
I could hardly endure the pain
I could read between the lines
I did something I regret doing
I do work related to computers
I dreamed about Tom last night
I expect everyone to work hard
I explained the process to him
I feel awkward in his presence
I feel like I missed something
I feel like eating out tonight
I feel ready for the challenge
I feel that something is wrong
I finally got across the river
I forgot to lock the storeroom
I forgot to tell you something
I found the question very easy
I gained two kilos this summer
I gave her her dictionary back
I gave my brother a dictionary
I got this bicycle for nothing
I grew up eating Japanese food
I had a pretty happy childhood
I had an interesting day today
I had an operation last summer
I had to find another solution
I hate that more than anything
I have a reservation for today
I have a slight headache today
I have gotten him into trouble
I have never been there myself
I have not eaten breakfast yet
I have seen him quite recently
I have three pieces of baggage
I have two children to support
I hope Tom remembered to shave
I hope that everything is okay
I hope this fine weather holds
I hope you all learn something
I hope you find it interesting
I hope you learned your lesson
I immediately knew what it was
I informed her of my departure
I just listened and kept quiet
I just want to check something
I just wanted to play baseball
I knew nobody would believe me
I knew that someone would come
I knew that would interest you
I knew there was a possibility
I know almost nothing about it
I know him better than anybody
I like green peppers very much
I like having people around me
I like hiking in the mountains
I like listening to good music
I like my coffee without sugar
I like neither of the pictures
I like playing tennis and golf
I like spring better than fall
I like to invent useful things
I like your techno dance moves
I live right around the corner
I lived overseas for ten years
I love all my children equally
I love the taste of watermelon
I love traveling in the winter
I made him carry the briefcase
I made this doghouse by myself
I met him on several occasions
I mistook you for your brother
I need help painting the fence
I need something to write with
I need your full attention now
I never care about such things
I never get invited to parties
I never needed that much money
I never thought anything of it
I never thought of that before
I never thought that about you
I only wish that were possible
I packed your suitcase for you
I poured water into the bucket
I quit smoking three years ago
I really have to eat something
I really like hard boiled eggs
I really think you should come
I rented out the guest bedroom
I respect my teacher very much
I respect you more than anyone
I sometimes dream of my mother
I suggested that we go fishing
I think Tom is still breathing
I think Tom only speaks French
I think Tom really deserves it
I think my suitcase was stolen
I think that could be arranged
I think the KGB was implicated
I think things will get better
I think this is totally absurd
I think you know everyone here
I think you should get started
I think your answer is correct
I thought that he was innocent
I thought we were best friends
I thought we were welcome here
I thought you wanted a divorce
I thought you wanted the truth
I thought you wanted this back
I told myself to stay positive
I took his umbrella by mistake
I took what she said literally
I understand the reason for it
I usually drive myself to work
I usually have dinner at seven
I waited until the last minute
I want answers to my questions
I want something cold to drink
I want that more than anything
I want to do something special
I want to drink something cold
I want to make something clear
I want to personally thank you
I want to recover my valuables
I want to thank everybody here
I want you to listen carefully
I wanted to know what happened
I was actually kind of serious
I was always interested in art
I was disappointed by the news
I was drinking tea all morning
I was excited by the challenge
I was expecting a tougher game
I was expecting you last night
I was fascinated by her beauty
I was just making a suggestion
I was late for the appointment
I was outside when it happened
I was really worried about you
I was very satisfied with this
I was working when it happened
I was worried about his health
I will give him another chance
I will never forget seeing you
I will speak with you tomorrow
I wonder what she really means
I wonder why women outlive men
I would like you to understand
It appears that he is mistaken
It feels horrible to be pitied
It is necessary to lose weight
It is not the correct solution
It is something my mother made
It kept raining for three days
It might just be a coincidence
It must be done more carefully
It rained heavily all day long
It stopped snowing an hour ago
It was everything he hoped for
It was not very cold yesterday
It will be fine this afternoon
It will soon be breakfast time
Just seeing it made me nervous
Keep it at a lower temperature
Keep your hands off my bicycle
Let me remind you of something
Life begins when you are forty
Listen carefully to what I say
Look at yourself in the mirror
Madrid is the capital of Spain
Mary and I became good friends
Mary stayed up late last night
Mary wants to become a teacher
Mary wore a simple white dress
Memorize the poem by next week
Men and women went into battle
Money makes the world go round
My boss is very cheerful today
My brother has become a priest
My brother is in Australia now
My brother is now in Australia
My brother is stronger than me
My dog goes everywhere with me
My family are all early risers
My father is an expert surgeon
My father is far from artistic
My favorite dance is the tango
My favorite music is pop music
My feet are smaller than yours
My girlfriend is a good dancer
My grandma has gotten very old
My husband is the jealous type
My mother plays the piano well
My parents live in the country
My passport is no longer valid
My throat hurts when I swallow
My uncle lives in an apartment
My uncle lives near the school
No one can foretell the future
No one said anything like that
No one thinks that way anymore
Nobody has made a decision yet
Nobody invited me to the party
None of those books are useful
Not everybody can be an artist
Nothing can be worse than that
One of my suitcases is missing
Only love can break your heart
Our country has a rich history
Our plans are not yet concrete
Our school is across the river
Our school is near the station
Our yacht club has ten members
Parents need a lot of patience
Paris is the capital of France
Pay attention to what Tom says
People believed her to be dead
People like you are never busy
Please call me before you come
Please have someone else do it
Please speak in a louder voice
Please take me to this address
Please wait around for a while
Please write down what he says
Put your valuables in the safe
Read as many books as possible
Read this book at your leisure
She advised him on that matter
She advised him to be punctual
She advised him to lose weight
She advised him to work harder
She and her friends love music
She belongs to the tennis club
She borrowed the book from him
She called him every other day
She called me in the afternoon
She can say whatever she wants
She carried off all the prizes
She climbed down from the roof
She cooked us a wonderful meal
She drew the chair towards her
She earns more than she spends
She expected him to leave town
She explained the matter to me
She fainted when she saw blood
She filled her bag with apples
She filled the glass with wine
She filled the vase with water
She finished the job with ease
She gets good marks in English
She got the ticket for nothing
She has a heated swimming pool
She has a very beautiful laugh
She has put on weight recently
She has very few close friends
She helped me pack my suitcase
She hopes to become a designer
She ignored him almost all day
She insisted on my going there
She is always dressed in black
She is always kind to everyone
She is anxious to visit Europe
She is appearing on TV tonight
She is certain to be surprised
She is devoted to her children
She is lacking in common sense
She is very cynical about life
She is wearing a valuable ring
She kept crying all night long
She kept the secret to herself
She kept various kinds of pets
She laid the child down gently
She left home after three days
She likes going to the library
She likes nothing but the best
She lives just down the street
She looks odd in those clothes
She looks pretty in that dress
She may not come here tomorrow
She mistook the sugar for salt
She must have seen better days
She must have worked very hard
She paid to attend the concert
She persuaded him to marry her
She plays the violin very well
She prodded him to work harder
She provided me with some food
She quickly went up the stairs
She refused to accept the post
She revealed the secret to him
She scolded him for being late
She sent me an urgent telegram
She stood close to her husband
She thanked me for the present
She thought of a good solution
She threw herself into my arms
She tried to hide her feelings
She walked slowly away from me
She warmed herself by the fire
She was afraid to travel alone
She was almost late for school
She was bewitched by his smile
She was buried in her hometown
She was busy with her knitting
She was coming down the stairs
She was doing the washing then
She was shaken by the accident
She watched him draw a picture
She will report directly to me
She will return within an hour
She would not follow my advice
She wrote a book about animals
Shut all the doors and windows
Smoking is bad for your health
Snow reminds me of my hometown
So far everything is all right
Some apples rotted on the tree
Someone has cut my kite string
Someone is tapping at the door
Sorry to have kept you waiting
Stop acting like such a weirdo
Stop crying like a little girl
Stop putting off finding a job
Stop sucking up to the teacher
Sulfur is used to make matches
Swimming is a form of exercise
Take a picture with your phone
Take your elbows off the table
Tell Tom that everyone is here
Tell me exactly where he lives
Tell them we need an ambulance
Thank you for closing the door
Thanks for coming all this way
That amounts to the same thing
That baby does nothing but cry
That child can count to twenty
That child is full of mischief
That flower has a strong smell
That is a very complex machine
That is actually what I wanted
That makes perfect sense to me
That mountain is in the clouds
That should be kept between us
That was easier than I thought
The army advanced on the enemy
The army had plenty of weapons
The arrow glanced off the tree
The baby kept crying all night
The balloon is filled with air
The boat sank during the storm
The boy made his parents happy
The boy takes after his father
The capital of Ukraine is Kiev
The capital of Ukraine is Kyiv
The car crashed into the truck
The castle is across the river
The city was destroyed by fire
The clown fell down on purpose
The cola made my tongue tingle
The computer is in the library
The cottage was clean and tidy
The dog barked at the stranger
The dog barks at all strangers
The door was difficult to open
The earth moves around the sun
The enemy attack ended at dawn
The enemy attacked us at night
The fire burnt ten houses down
The hedgehog is a small animal
The ice watered down the juice
The injured man cried for help
The insulin was making her fat
The law is full of ambiguities
The leaves fell from the trees
The letter was addressed to me
The letter was written by hand
The matter is of no importance
The mayor is not available now
The meeting went on until noon
The men went hunting for lions
The moon was bright last night
The murderer is still at large
The news spread all over Japan
The next day was Christmas Day
The old couple had no children
The pain has lessened a little
The pamphlet is free of charge
The police are looking into it
The police still have no leads
The pressure is getting to him
The prices remain as they were
The problem is not settled yet
The rabbit hid behind the tree
The rain came down in torrents
The rain lasted for three days
The reason for this is obvious
The room is spacious and light
The school looks like a prison
The school year is almost over
The show starts in ten minutes
The sky grew darker and darker
The sky is covered with clouds
The soldiers could see him now
The statue is missing its head
The store closed down for good
The stream flows into the pond
The talks will last three days
The theory is not accepted yet
The tower is going to collapse
The train is bound for Niigata
The trees are beginning to bud
The two men accused each other
The two teams fought very hard
The visitor sat across from me
The wall was coated with paint
The water here is very shallow
The widow was dressed in black
There are many kinds of coffee
There are many parks in Boston
There is a limit to everything
There is a time for everything
There is no life without water
There is no smoke without fire
There is something I must know
These are gifts for my friends
These shoes are a little loose
They all thought Tom was crazy
They are always short of money
They are boiling water for tea
They are happy with the result
They are loyal to their master
They are not at all interested
They are probably all dead now
They asserted that it was true
They drank two bottles of wine
They go to church every Sunday
They had to start from scratch
They kept talking all the time
They live on the floor beneath
They look similar in some ways
They made up an unlikely story
They make toys at this factory
They must have had an accident
They never found out the truth
They really slept on the floor
They said they would not fight
They went on talking for hours
They were caught in a blizzard
They were dancing to the music
They would prefer that we wait
Things are getting out of hand
Things would never be the same
This bomb can kill many people
This book is missing two pages
This booklet is free of charge
This came for you this morning
This coffee has a bitter taste
This guy can do amazing things
This is a pretty amazing place
This machine is familiar to me
This medicine will do you good
This milk has a peculiar smell
This milk has a peculiar taste
This music is making me sleepy
This paper does not absorb ink
This rule applies to all cases
This telephone is out of order
This train is bound for Boston
This was supposed to be simple
This week I had three midterms
Tom and Mary are playing chess
Tom and Mary did that together
Tom and Mary were both smiling
Tom asked Mary where she lived
Tom began putting on his shoes
Tom bought a camera like yours
Tom bought a new tennis racket
Tom could probably tell us why
Tom decided to call the police
Tom did time for armed robbery
Tom dragged himself out of bed
Tom eats rice almost every day
Tom explained his plan to Mary
Tom explained why he was there
Tom felt someone touch his arm
Tom gathered wood for the fire
Tom gave Mary his phone number
Tom got these tickets for free
Tom handed an envelope to Mary
Tom has a large gun collection
Tom has a meeting this morning
Tom has already gone to school
Tom has an apartment in Boston
Tom has been blind since birth
Tom has been hammering all day
Tom has changed his mind again
Tom has never danced with Mary
Tom has some pretty good ideas
Tom has too many strange ideas
Tom has until Monday to decide
Tom has volunteered to help us
Tom helped Mary open the crate
Tom is a high school principal
Tom is a very ambitious person
Tom is acting a little strange
Tom is always late to meetings
Tom is determined to help Mary
Tom is determined to stop Mary
Tom is exactly like his father
Tom is exactly three weeks old
Tom is familiar with this area
Tom is good at telling stories
Tom is looking for another job
Tom is looking for his glasses
Tom is sleeping in his bedroom
Tom is studying in the library
Tom is teaching French to Mary
Tom is trying to say something
Tom is upstairs in his bedroom
Tom is used to making speeches
Tom is very interested in jazz
Tom is worried sick about Mary
Tom left his wife and children
Tom likes most of his teachers
Tom likes to cook Chinese food
Tom lived there for many years
Tom looked like he was unhappy
Tom lost his fight with cancer
Tom loved his family very much
Tom makes more money than Mary
Tom needs to leave early today
Tom paused to catch his breath
Tom promised to tell the truth
Tom pushed Mary out the window
Tom recently dyed his hair red
Tom saw Mary earlier this week
Tom says he regrets doing that
Tom should do as Mary suggests
Tom stared blankly at the wall
Tom still comes here every day
Tom still has feelings for you
Tom stormed out of the meeting
Tom took good care of everyone
Tom took one of the sandwiches
Tom tried to conceal the truth
Tom tried to tell me something
Tom wants to get married again
Tom wants to know your opinion
Tom was dismissed from his job
Tom was given a warm reception
Tom was wearing a baseball cap
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Try to be generous and forgive
Two families live in the house
Two girls played on the seesaw
Two tears fell down her cheeks
Water and oil are both liquids
We advised them to start early
We all helped with the harvest
We all know what happened here
We are facing a violent crisis
We are going to leave tomorrow
We arrived here in the evening
We can deliver it this evening
We finally arrived at the lake
We found the front door locked
We got married three years ago
We have a very serious problem
We have an English class today
We have arrived safe and sound
We have many purchases to make
We have no need for assistance
We have plenty of time tonight
We have room for thirty people
We have some celebrating to do
We have to tell them something
We heard shots in the distance
We heard the sound of gunshots
We just arrived at the station
We learn a lot from experience
We live in a civilized society
We live in a complicated world
We live near the large library
We must do more than yesterday
We must not forget our promise
We must start at the beginning
We must take care of ourselves
We picked the number at random
We reached the station on time
We really can make this happen
We skipped his turn on purpose
We took turns with the driving
We were all at school together
We were nearly frozen to death
We wish you a pleasant journey
What he says is total nonsense
You are no longer welcome here
You can still change your mind
You can take whatever you like
You did not answer my question
You had better take her advice
You have such a beautiful name
You have to speak English here
You look good in those clothes
You look great in these photos
You look just like your father
You look just like your mother
You may bring whoever you like
You may invite anyone you like
You may take anything you like
You must keep your hands clean
You must stick to your promise
You must study your whole life
You must take care of yourself
You need to be more aggressive
You never cease to surprise me
You really must see that movie
You said that it was important
You should always do your best
You should buy it for yourself
You should carry out your duty
You should have kept it secret
You should have listened to me
You should have seen the movie
You should kick that bad habit
You should listen to your wife
You should not waste your time
You should put on some clothes
You sound like a broken record
You were beginning to worry me
You will find this lesson easy
You would make a good diplomat
Your efforts will soon pay off
Your glasses fell on the floor
Your proposal is a bit extreme
Your remarks were out of place
Your sacrifice was not in vain
Your son is dating my daughter
Your watch is ten minutes slow
A broken mirror brings bad luck
A computer is a complex machine
A fierce battle was fought here
A good idea suddenly struck her
A map is available upon request
A number of people were drowned
A woman asked me for directions
A wonderful idea occurred to me
A word spoken is past recalling
Add two ounces of grated cheese
All children do not like apples
All good things come from above
All his friends backed his plan
All my friends are invited here
All of my friends have bicycles
All our effort ended in failure
All plants need water and light
All the children laughed at Tom
All the desk drawers were empty
All the students have gone home
America is a land of immigrants
An expert was called for advice
Ankara is the capital of Turkey
Be careful not to hurt yourself
Beijing is the capital of China
Birds make their nests in trees
Both countries are now at peace
Both of my brothers are married
Both of the windows were broken
Both of them are very brilliant
Call me at six tomorrow morning
Carry her to the operating room
Cars took the place of bicycles
Cats are smarter than you think
Children often ask me for money
Choose any one from among these
Christmas is only two weeks off
Click here to create an account
Come to my house this afternoon
Condors have never bred in zoos
Cross out all the wrong answers
Curiosity got the better of him
Dinner is probably ready by now
Do not cast pearls before swine
Edison was not a bright student
Education is the key to success
Election day was cold and rainy
English is not my mother tongue
Every cloud has a silver lining
Everyone in her class likes her
Everyone in town knows his name
Everything is all right at home
Everything is now ready for you
Everything seems to be in order
Farmers sow seeds in the spring
Friendship is a matter of trust
Get out your notebooks and pens
Give credit where credit is due
Give me something cold to drink
Give me something to write with
Go straight on down this street
Grammar is a very complex thing
Half of the students are absent
Hamlet is a play by Shakespeare
He always borrows money from me
He broke his arm playing soccer
He broke in on our conversation
He came home at almost midnight
He can hardly speak any English
He confessed that he was guilty
He demanded payment of the debt
He disguised himself as a woman
He does not like being punished
He does nothing but read comics
He drank three glasses of water
He earns his living by teaching
He feels weak after his illness
He felt himself being lifted up
He filled the bottle with water
He filled the bucket with water
He goes fishing every other day
He goes to Karuizawa every year
He got dressed and went outside
He grows tomatoes in his garden
He hastily wrote down our names
He introduced me to his parents
He invested his money in stocks
He is a very imaginative writer
He is absent because of illness
He is acquainted with the mayor
He is afraid of his grandfather
He is afraid of making mistakes
He is always looking for praise
He is careful about his manners
He is included among my friends
He is reasonable in his demands
He is satisfied with the result
He is suffering from a headache
He is unpopular for some reason
He kept standing against a tree
He knows he did something wrong
He likes swimming in the summer
He lives apart from his parents
He lives just around the corner
He looks down on everybody else
He made a gesture of impatience
He makes everybody feel at ease
He needs to answer the question
He needs to lower his standards
He never gave way to temptation
He never speaks of the accident
He really likes traveling a lot
He remained single all his life
He reminds me of my grandfather
He secretly showed me her photo
He seemed surprised at the news
He seldom stays home on Sundays
He solved the problem with ease
He stood gazing at the painting
He threatened to make it public
He told me an interesting story
He took a walk before breakfast
He took back everything he said
He turned the table upside down
He wants to be more independent
He was bleeding from his wounds
He was buried in this graveyard
He was conscious of his mistake
He was desperate to get married
He was discharged from the army
He was finally forced to resign
He was killed in the earthquake
He was leaning against the wall
He was lonely after his divorce
He was unaware of the situation
He was unconscious of his guilt
He will travel abroad next year
He wishes to erase bad memories
He worked hard to promote peace
He writes letters to his mother
He wrote about plants and trees
Helen Keller was deaf and blind
Her eyes were filled with tears
Her hair comes to her shoulders
His father approved of his plan
His horse jumped over the fence
His mother is worried about him
His record will never be broken
His way of speaking offended me
His wife is our Italian teacher
I accomplished what I wanted to
I always try to stay optimistic
I always wanted to be different
I am accustomed to cold weather
I am accustomed to living alone
I am accustomed to working hard
I am acquainted with the author
I am acquainted with the custom
I am against working on Sundays
I am concerned about his health
I am convinced of his innocence
I am familiar with this subject
I am fixing the washing machine
I am not frightened of anything
I am seeing Mary this afternoon
I am thinking about my children
I am thinking about that matter
I appreciate what you did today
I believe Tom will be acquitted
I believe he is coming tomorrow
I believe it will snow tomorrow
I brought these flowers for you
I built this doghouse by myself
I can barely stand his behavior
I can be assertive if necessary
I caught him stealing the money
I certainly have had great luck
I certainly would like a refund
I change my underwear every day
I changed my address last month
I climbed in through the window
I come from a humble background
I could not attend the ceremony
I could not have done otherwise
I could see something was wrong
I did not play tennis yesterday
I do the shopping every morning
I explained the accident to him
I feel really strongly about it
I feel way more comfortable now
I felt my heart beating rapidly
I fixed myself something to eat
I forgot to telephone him today
I grow orchids in my greenhouse
I had my watch stolen yesterday
I hate being alone at Christmas
I have absolutely nothing to do
I have already done my homework
I have already finished the job
I have already had my breakfast
I have already written a letter
I have enclosed your order form
I have enjoyed myself very much
I have finally reached my limit
I have hardly any English books
I have never heard him complain
I have never tried Chinese food
I have no friends supporting me
I have no intention of changing
I have nothing particular to do
I heard someone calling my name
I heard the front doorbell ring
I heard voices through the wall
I hope this is resolved quickly
I hope you feel better tomorrow
I introduced Mary to my parents
I just feel a little inadequate
I just want what everyone wants
I just wanted to thank everyone
I knew Tom would be heartbroken
I know almost nothing about you
I know that better than anybody
I know that you are vegetarians
I know who painted this picture
I lather my face before shaving
I let my guard down momentarily
I like bananas more than apples
I like trains better than buses
I like working for this company
I liked having you here tonight
I love the beaches in Australia
I made myself a turkey sandwich
I missed the last bus yesterday
I must be doing something wrong
I must get my homework finished
I must have my bicycle repaired
I need someone to understand me
I need to take your temperature
I negotiated the price with him
I never drink beer before lunch
I never expected that to happen
I never had a girlfriend before
I never stop thinking about you
I never thought about it before
I never thought it would happen
I never wanted to have children
I often refer to the dictionary
I ordered the book from Britain
I ordered the book from England
I pretended that I was sleeping
I read that report before lunch
I really believed it would work
I really think you should leave
I recognized her at first sight
I refuse to answer the question
I regret that this all happened
I remember meeting him in Paris
I remember seeing you last year
I respect you and your opinions
I said nothing about the matter
I should never have stolen that
I succeeded in my first attempt
I suddenly feel very much alone
I support you a hundred percent
I sure appreciate all your help
I thought that she was pregnant
I thought your parents liked me
I took control of the situation
I took your umbrella by mistake
I visited her on Sunday morning
I visited him on Sunday morning
I visited many parts of England
I want everything to be perfect
I want to make her acquaintance
I was homeless for three months
I was impatient for her arrival
I was late for school yesterday
I was really apathetic at first
I was waiting for that question
I watch television all day long
I wear white shirts on weekdays
I will answer within three days
I will be sixteen next birthday
I will complete what he started
I wish it were tomorrow already
I wish they would stop fighting
I wonder what this phrase means
I wonder who started that rumor
I work in a hospital laboratory
I would like to drink something
I would never have guessed that
I wrote some poems last weekend
It becomes warmer day after day
It fell short of my expectation
It is getting darker and darker
It is getting warmer and warmer
It is ten minutes before eleven
It is terribly hot this morning
It may well rain before tonight
It used to be nearly impossible
It was shorter than he expected
Just stay away from my daughter
Keep your hands above the table
Kids are smarter than you think
Kids love pasta in tomato sauce
Last summer we went to Hokkaido
Laughing is really good for you
Leave your umbrella in the hall
Let a porter carry your baggage
Life is getting hard these days
Listen to what the teacher says
Lots of famous people come here
Many of the students were tired
Many paintings hang in the shop
Many plants bloom in the spring
Mars has a very thin atmosphere
Mary made her own wedding dress
Maybe it really was an accident
Maybe it was just a coincidence
Maybe we should come back later
Movie making is an exciting job
My English is anything but good
My bicycle needs to be repaired
My blood pressure is quite high
My brother is a college student
My children were born in Boston
My dog eats just about anything
My father hates the summer heat
My father is absent on business
My father repaired my old watch
My friend is a talkative person
My friends invited me to dinner
My hands are stained with paint
My heart was filled with sorrow
My house seems small beside his
My idea is different from yours
My mother made some new clothes
My mother was usually very busy
My older brother is watching TV
My parents are no longer living
My plan is different from yours
My sister is crazy about tennis
My sister is playing with dolls
My sister plays piano every day
My sister was a beautiful woman
Never rely too much upon others
Night is when most people sleep
No one cares about that anymore
No one said anything about that
Nobody had anything else to say
Now she understands what I mean
Of course she can speak English
One of the dogs started barking
Only adults may watch that film
Ottawa is the capital of Canada
Our garden has two cherry trees
Our school was reduced to ashes
Our stay has been very pleasant
Our supply of food is exhausted
Please come as soon as possible
Please excuse me for being rude
Please explain how to get there
Please freeze the fish and meat
Please give me something to eat
Please knock before you come in
Please let me take your picture
Please put yourself in my place
Please remember to write to her
Please say hello to your family
Please serve him his meal first
Please show me your injured arm
Please show me your stamp album
Please shut the door behind you
Please stay at my house tonight
Printing ink is in short supply
See you tomorrow in the library
She accompanied me on the piano
She admitted that she was wrong
She advised him to stop smoking
She advised him to study harder
She always keeps her hair clean
She always speaks ill of others
She appears to have few friends
She argued with him about money
She asserted that she was right
She attacked him with her fists
She bought the dress on impulse
She broke the window on purpose
She can speak English very well
She could not cope with anxiety
She demanded to see the manager
She did nothing but look around
She explained her reasons to us
She failed every time she tried
She felt her heart beat quickly
She felt someone touch her back
She found her baby still asleep
She gave him something to drink
She gave me a wonderful present
She greeted him waving her hand
She grows many kinds of flowers
She had nothing to do yesterday
She has already left the office
She hired him as an interpreter
She informed me of her decision
She introduced me to her father
She introduced me to her sister
She is a most gracious neighbor
She is an expert in mathematics
She is anxious about her safety
She is being blackmailed by him
She is distantly related to him
She is good at speaking English
She just laughed the matter off
She listened to music for hours
She lives in an apartment alone
She looked out through the hole
She loves to wear tight clothes
She made the same mistake again
She must have done it yesterday
She passed by without seeing me
She planted roses in the garden
She poured water into the basin
She praised him for his honesty
She promised not to tell anyone
She refused to accept the money
She says that she likes flowers
She showed me around the campus
She touched him on the shoulder
She translated it word for word
She traveled all over the world
She tried to lower her expenses
She was a genius in mathematics
She was busy doing her homework
She was busy with the housework
She was sticking her tongue out
She was washing the dishes then
She went to see him reluctantly
She wondered which door to open
Sit down here and warm yourself
Smoke poured out of the chimney
Some animals are afraid of fire
Someday my dream will come true
Someone has stolen all my money
Someone is hiding in the corner
Someone is knocking at the door
Someone is knocking on the door
Someone must have left it there
Spring will be here before long
Stars were twinkling in the sky
Sweat is dripping from his face
Tell us a little about yourself
Ten prisoners broke out of jail
Thanks for telling me the truth
That dress matches her red hair
That is sold at hardware stores
That law is full of ambiguities
That never even crossed my mind
That place is open to everybody
That was well worth the trouble
That work was done very quickly
That would appear to be correct
The Ferris wheel is my favorite
The baby takes after his mother
The baby was shaking the rattle
The ball rolled across the road
The bathtub needs to be cleaned
The buses run every ten minutes
The cake was crawling with ants
The capital of Poland is Warsaw
The car is not illegally parked
The clock has just struck three
The concert was a great success
The doctor is not available now
The door opens into the bedroom
The door was locked from within
The dressing room is over there
The drunk driver damaged a tree
The early bird catches the worm
The ground is covered with snow
The guitar player is my brother
The last train has already gone
The meeting was just about over
The milk froze and became solid
The museum is closed on Mondays
The new medicine saved his life
The news filled her with sorrow
The old man tends to exaggerate
The place is surrounded by cops
The plane flew above the clouds
The plane will land before long
The police accused him of theft
The police want to question you
The post office is closed today
The room was filled with people
The rope broke under the strain
The same holds true for Germany
The ship was scuttled last year
The stock market is very active
The storm caused a power outage
The teachers teach all day long
The tide is turning against Tom
The traffic lights were all red
The train was late this morning
The virus is starting to mutate
The war began three years later
The waves swallowed up the boat
The whole class passed the test
The world did not recognize him
There are many tourists in town
There are no secrets between us
There is little hope of success
There is nothing to worry about
There is nothing wrong with him
There was some dew this morning
These boxes are made of plastic
These cameras are made in Japan
These flowers you see are roses
These windows look to the south
They all laughed at their error
They all went to the restaurant
They are from the United States
They are jealous of our success
They are talking in the kitchen
They both want to say something
They come from the same country
They come from the same village
They grow flowers in the garden
They had a lovely time together
They had once helped each other
They have access to the library
They hold me responsible for it
They just want someone to blame
They moved here three years ago
They said that it was important
They walked along a narrow path
They wash their hands with soap
They went to America last month
Things might get a little rough
This book is a fascinating read
This camera was made in Germany
This could become a big problem
This does not apply to students
This fact must not be forgotten
This is a very nutritious lunch
This is an entirely new problem
This is probably a real diamond
This is where the magic happens
This letter is addressed to you
This looks like a gunshot wound
This phrase might come in handy
This phrase seems correct to me
This place is open to everybody
This sentence is not in English
This should be more than enough
This stuff happens all the time
This suit is anything but cheap
This sword is in fair condition
This text is aimed at beginners
This was not supposed to happen
This will make a big difference
This word is derived from Latin
Time is the most precious thing
Today is election day in Poland
Tom allowed Mary to leave early
Tom always likes to joke around
Tom and I study French together
Tom and Mary are playing tennis
Tom and Mary danced all evening
Tom and Mary have been drinking
Tom and Mary were both suspects
Tom bought Mary lots of jewelry
Tom bought three pairs of shoes
Tom certainly drives a nice car
Tom certainly goes to bed early
Tom comes here every three days
Tom comes here nearly every day
Tom dove into the swimming pool
Tom explained the problem to me
Tom followed Mary into the room
Tom gave me everything I needed
Tom has stopped going to school
Tom has the information we need
Tom hurried out of the building
Tom introduced his sister to me
Tom is probably in the building
Tom is throwing stones at birds
Tom is wearing a pirate costume
Tom jumped off the diving board
Tom kept his opinion to himself
Tom kissed Mary on the forehead
Tom knew Mary would arrive late
Tom knows how to cook spaghetti
Tom looked like a weight lifter
Tom made the same mistake again
Tom moved here three months ago
Tom never gave in to temptation
Tom punched John in the stomach
Tom really wants to lose weight
Tom refused to tell us anything
Tom saw something on the ground
Tom should have told me earlier
Tom spent three weeks in Boston
Tom spent three years in prison
Tom still thinks Mary likes him
Tom thought that Mary loved him
Tom told Mary what had happened
Tom told me about your concerns
Tom waited for Mary to continue
Tom wants to ask Mary something
Tom wants to show you something
Tom was beginning to feel tired
Tom was killed in the explosion
Tom was my first real boyfriend
Tom was only three minutes late
Tom will be arriving any moment
Tom will never believe me again
Turn right at the second corner
Twelve divided by three is four
Two families live in that house
Very little is known about them
Vladivostok is a city in Russia
Wait till the light turns green
War is a crime against humanity
We advertise our products on TV
We are anxious for their safety
We are leaving Japan next month
We are pretty much in agreement
We ate fresh fruit after dinner
We bought a new washing machine
We had an earthquake last night
We have to save him immediately
We intended to start right away
We need that report by tomorrow
We need this report by tomorrow
We need to discuss this further
We often talk about the weather
We should be proud of ourselves
We should have taken his advice
We should let sleeping dogs lie
We took turns cleaning the room
We want to make everybody happy
We went to high school together
We work every day except Sunday
What bothers me is his attitude
Wild animals live in the forest
Wipe your feet before coming in
Yesterday a truck hit this wall
You always take things too easy
You are always doubting my word
You are very attractive in blue
You are very early this morning
You could get arrested for that
You have to believe in yourself
You have to protect your family
You know where the problem lies
You look gorgeous in that dress
You may invite whoever you like
You might be interested in this
You must obey the traffic rules
You need to respect the elderly
You said there was an emergency
You should be proud of yourself
You should conform to the rules
You should keep your mouth shut
You should listen to his advice
You take your job too seriously
Your English has improved a lot
Your answer is far from perfect
Your bicycle is similar to mine
Your car has a broken taillight
Your idea is not entirely crazy
Your kiss is sweeter than honey
Your name sounds familiar to me
Your parents know where you are
Your problem is similar to mine
Your question is hard to answer
Your shirt button is coming off
Your team is stronger than ours
Your wristwatch is on the table
A crowd soon gathered around him
A father provides for his family
A new road is under construction
A revolution broke out in Mexico
A right angle has ninety degrees
A river flows through the valley
A sin confessed is half forgiven
A toothache deprived me of sleep
All I want is some companionship
All of the students were present
All of them were handmade things
All of us climbed aboard quickly
All the parking spots were taken
All the players were in position
All the students passed the test
Almost all the doors were closed
Berlin is the capital of Germany
Birds are flying above the trees
Brush your teeth after each meal
Cigarette smoke bothers me a lot
DNA tests showed he was innocent
Darkness is the absence of light
Death is often compared to sleep
Dinosaurs used to rule the earth
Dust had accumulated on the desk
Each country has its own customs
England was invaded by the Danes
English is also studied in China
English is not my first language
Ethics is a branch of philosophy
Even a teacher can make mistakes
Everybody plays the game of love
Everyone was shocked by the news
Everyone was silent for a minute
Everything is now back to normal
Everything that Tom said is true
Exercise is good for your health
Faded jeans are still in fashion
Father got the drink for nothing
Father showed him into the study
Few people know the true meaning
Find Tom before he tells someone
Germany then had a powerful army
Guess whose birthday it is today
He acts like he knows everything
He advertised his house for sale
He became rich through hard work
He calculated the speed of light
He continued walking for a while
He convinced me of his innocence
He convinced us of her innocence
He decided to have the operation
He explained the facts at length
He felt nervous about the result
He has already finished his work
He has nothing to complain about
He has some knowledge of editing
He inherited an old wooden chest
He introduced his daughter to me
He is a potential world champion
He is accustomed to working hard
He is acquainted with the custom
He is always losing his umbrella
He is in good physical condition
He is independent of his parents
He is staying with his relatives
He is the greatest living artist
He is uncertain about his future
He keeps making the same mistake
He knows a lot about butterflies
He leaped over the shallow ditch
He left for no reason whatsoever
He likes French more than German
He looked back over his shoulder
He managed to climb the mountain
He never gets invited to parties
He never speaks unless spoken to
He pressed the button and waited
He pretended not to be listening
He promises not to drink anymore
He ran past without noticing her
He ran through the streets naked
He readily agreed to my proposal
He repaired his watch by himself
He risked losing all his fortune
He sat surrounded by young girls
He showed signs of great emotion
He sold his business and retired
He speaks English better than me
He telephoned me again and again
He thinks of nothing but himself
He wants something cold to drink
He was absent because of illness
He was accused of stealing money
He was banished from the kingdom
He was conscious of her presence
He was satisfied with the result
He was successful in the attempt
He was wearing a threadbare suit
He went backstage after the show
He will arrive in Kyoto tomorrow
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow
He works for an American company
Her face was drenched with sweat
Her father passed away last week
Her husband is an excellent cook
Her late husband was a violinist
Her long hair was completely wet
Her mother will continue to work
His behavior is worthy of praise
His criticisms were out of place
His father has never scolded him
His house is surrounded by trees
His identity must be kept secret
His paintings seem strange to me
His picture was in the newspaper
His rude behavior makes me angry
His shirt was stained with sauce
His son was expelled from school
History is not his major subject
I am convinced of your innocence
I am interested in Asian history
I am responsible for the mistake
I appreciate anything you can do
I attempted to solve the problem
I barely know anything about you
I believe things will get better
I brought you a little something
I brush my teeth after breakfast
I can hardly wait until tomorrow
I can hear a saxophone somewhere
I consider him a great scientist
I could answer all the questions
I explained the procedure to him
I feel very comfortable with you
I fell asleep listening to music
I finally have everything I need
I find that difficult to believe
I find this difficult to believe
I forgot that today was Saturday
I found the bed very comfortable
I had a nightmare about vampires
I had my bicycle fixed yesterday
I had to postpone my appointment
I had to work overtime yesterday
I hardly know anything about you
I have a lot of responsibilities
I have difficulty paying my rent
I have no intention of resigning
I have nothing particular to say
I have quit smoking and drinking
I have recently given up smoking
I heard him speak fluent English
I just finished reading the book
I just got your letter yesterday
I know a good Italian restaurant
I know that Tom likes basketball
I like English better than music
I like butter better than cheese
I like having breakfast with you
I like summer better than winter
I like watching movies in French
I love to paint with watercolors
I missed you very much yesterday
I often play soccer after school
I often play tennis after school
I often receive letters from him
I only got your letter yesterday
I recognized him at first glance
I recommend we keep our distance
I refuse to discuss the question
I remember giving Tom some money
I remember telling her that news
I slept through the entire movie
I speak Chinese almost every day
I spoke with the minister myself
I stayed with an American family
I stopped listening to the radio
I study math harder than English
I succeeded thanks to his advice
I think jogging is good exercise
I think our relationship is over
I think we need more information
I think we should stick together
I think you should take vitamins
I tried to maintain my composure
I usually have a light breakfast
I usually stay indoors on Sunday
I want to apologize to everybody
I was absent from work yesterday
I was deceived by her appearance
I was raised eating Mexican food
I went into partnership with him
I went to the hospital yesterday
I work different hours every day
I write letters almost every day
In autumn the leaves turn yellow
It may possibly be fine tomorrow
It sounds like someone is crying
It was getting louder and louder
It was less than fifteen dollars
It was shorter than she expected
Keep children away from the pond
Laughter is good for your health
Let them take care of themselves
Life without love has no meaning
London is the capital of England
Lots of people make that mistake
Many boys and girls were present
Mary claims you stole her pearls
Mary is prettier than her sister
Mary loves shoes with high heels
Maybe he has lots of girlfriends
Maybe you should call the police
More than twenty boys went there
Most Japanese eat rice every day
Mother has not cooked dinner yet
Mother is cooking in the kitchen
Motivation is the key to success
My baby has a hereditary disease
My boss turned down his proposal
My brother sends you his regards
My father can speak English well
My father is free this afternoon
My father is sweeping the garage
My father likes traveling by air
My father would often go fishing
My friend only eats organic food
My girlfriend often cuts my hair
My grandmother has a green thumb
My hobby is collecting old coins
My house is covered by insurance
My little brother is watching TV
My mother died during my absence
My mother does not speak English
My mother is busy cooking dinner
My son likes books about animals
My watch is different from yours
Never hesitate to tell the truth
Nobody has a landline these days
Not a single person arrived late
Nothing is as important as peace
Only you can answer the question
Opinion is divided on this point
Our only daughter died of cancer
Our passports were all we needed
Our plane is thirty minutes late
Our refrigerator is out of order
Our school is larger than theirs
Peace talks will begin next week
People thought that she was dead
Please close the door behind you
Please cut along the dotted line
Please forgive me for being late
Please help yourself to the cake
Please pardon me for coming late
Please reserve this table for us
Please say hello to your parents
Please tell Tom that Mary called
Please tell us about your family
Please wait outside of the house
School begins at half past eight
School begins on April the tenth
School violence is a big problem
Sea turtles have a long lifespan
She accompanied him on the piano
She advised him against doing it
She advised him to leave earlier
She advised him to stop drinking
She appears to have many friends
She bolted the doors and windows
She cooked us a delicious dinner
She could feel her knees shaking
She decided to take legal advice
She dived into the swimming pool
She drowned herself in some lake
She earns her living by teaching
She felt herself being lifted up
She found employment as a typist
She grows tomatoes in her garden
She had the decency to apologize
She happened to know his address
She has broken the toaster again
She has brought up five children
She has left her umbrella behind
She informed me of her departure
She introduced her sister to him
She introduced me to her brother
She is beautiful like her mother
She is convinced of my innocence
She is familiar with the subject
She is practicing the violin now
She kept on talking while eating
She knitted her father a sweater
She likes cooking for her family
She lived there about five years
She lived up to our expectations
She looked back on her childhood
She looked better than last time
She might have met him yesterday
She nodded her head in agreement
She ordered the book from London
She picked flowers in the garden
She pretty much keeps to herself
She remained single all her life
She reproached me for being lazy
She showed up early for practice
She solved the problem with ease
She spent the weekend by herself
She still depends on her parents
She stopped to smoke a cigarette
She succeeded in opening the box
She suffocated him with a pillow
She takes a shower every morning
She told me an interesting story
She told us an interesting story
She took a walk before breakfast
She urged him to drive carefully
She wants to marry a millionaire
She was anxious about his health
She was busy with household work
She was heard playing the violin
She was wearing dark brown shoes
She will leave the hospital soon
She wrapped the present in paper
Skating on the pond is dangerous
Sleeping in class is not allowed
Smoking is harmful to the health
Some animals are active at night
Some even accused him of treason
Some voters waited hours to vote
Something has happened to my car
Something is wrong with my watch
Speaking Japanese is easy for me
Spring is just around the corner
Start reading where you left off
Suicide is an act of desperation
Supplies of oil are not infinite
Swimming is good for your health
Take whichever of these you want
Talking during a concert is rude
Thank you for the Christmas gift
Thank you for the wonderful meal
That almost sounds like a threat
That bridge is anything but safe
That dress looks stunning on you
That flower has a powerful smell
That happened to me this morning
That movie was a real tearjerker
That play was an immense success
That small star is the brightest
That was some pretty good advice
That’s the man whose wife died
The Inca were a religious people
The Japanese live mainly on rice
The boat drifted down the stream
The boy complained of a headache
The boys played cops and robbers
The bullet cut through an artery
The bus leaves every ten minutes
The bus stopped in every village
The bus turned around the corner
The buses left one after another
The city was blanketed with snow
The clock is made in Switzerland
The cold weather kept us indoors
The customer is not always right
The doctor she visited is famous
The door remained closed all day
The fire was put out immediately
The floor was covered with blood
The frost killed all the flowers
The future will come soon enough
The girl was trembling with fear
The hills were covered with snow
The horse ran through the fields
The hotel has a homey atmosphere
The house collapsed a week later
The ice cracked under the weight
The king reigned over the island
The land had never been ploughed
The middle finger is the longest
The new museum is worth visiting
The painting is all but finished
The peace talks ended in failure
The plan was discussed in detail
The plane flew over the mountain
The plane made a perfect landing
The planes flew over the village
The police accused him of murder
The police chased the stolen car
The problem remains to be solved
The sky became darker and darker
The snow was several meters deep
The students made her life happy
The swimmers were numb with cold
The table was covered with paper
The talks continued for two days
The town has many tall buildings
The traffic light changed to red
The tree was struck by lightning
The two answers are both correct
The two brothers are still alive
The water flows under the bridge
The young adapt to change easily
The young girl lost her bracelet
The young should respect the old
There are few houses around here
There are many islands in Greece
There are many mysteries in life
There is no school during August
There is nothing wrong with this
There is something you must know
There must be something in there
There was a heavy rain yesterday
There was a light rain yesterday
There was no question about that
There was only one small problem
These gloves kept her hands warm
These houses were dark and dirty
These trees were planted by them
They appointed him as a director
They are both colleagues of mine
They are expected any minute now
They charge too much for parking
They could not get there quickly
They did not have good equipment
They fit each other so perfectly
They gave us very little trouble
They hurried by without a glance
They mistook him for his brother
They refused to think of leaving
They were better than I expected
They were not listening to music
They were scolded by the teacher
They will get married next month
This blue sweater is very pretty
This boat is no longer seaworthy
This book is worth reading again
This book is worth reading twice
This car has no air conditioning
This doll costs only sixty cents
This is more expensive than that
This lawn mower runs on gasoline
This packaging is hard to remove
This plant grew little by little
This should be clear to everyone
This story has an unhappy ending
This sword has a strange history
This train stops at all stations
This tree is three meters around
This will be a great opportunity
Three beers and a tequila please

Wait until your father gets home
We accept all major credit cards
We are anxious about your health
We associate Egypt with the Nile
We can solve this problem easily
We climbed up the steep mountain
We discussed a number of options
We discussed the topic at length
We find the defendant not guilty
We gain more knowledge every day
We grow vegetables in our garden
We have a party tomorrow evening
We have different points of view
We have had bad weather recently
We have little chance of winning
We have something else in common
We have to respect local customs
We heard gunshots from next door
We hope this never happens again
We should have been more careful
We should not resort to violence
We should probably ask Tom first
We stayed there for three months
We thought that you were married
We went to Australia last summer
We were surprised at his conduct
We will reach London before dark
When I phone them nobody answers
Worrying never does you any good

You have to tighten those screws
You know Tom better than anybody
You must make your parents happy
You must not indulge in drinking
You must not jump to conclusions
You must not smoke while working
You must not touch the paintings
You must not yield to temptation
You need to lower your standards
You need to reboot your computer
You need to redecorate your room
You ought to love your neighbors
You should always tell the truth
You should get your eyes checked
You should obey all traffic laws
You should take care of yourself
You work harder than anyone here
Your bicycle is better than mine
Your composition is the best yet
Your plan seems better than mine
Your sister is beautiful as ever
Your smile always makes me happy
A closed fist can indicate stress
A convict has escaped from prison
A fallen tree obstructed the road
A rainbow is a natural phenomenon
A squirrel hid among the branches
A stranger came into the building
A treatment will cure the disease
All took part in the negotiations
Almost all the leaves have fallen
Apples were served as the dessert
Brush your teeth after every meal
Carrots are good for the eyesight
Close your eyes for three minutes
Copper and silver are both metals
Elephants live in Asia and Africa
Every country has its own history
Everybody in the village knew him
Everybody is equal before the law

He remained silent the whole time
He resembles his father very much
He secretly showed me her picture
He sent me an affectionate letter
He showed me his photograph album
He teaches English to his friends
He tried to attract her attention
He used pigeons in his experiment
He visited many countries in Asia
He was conspicuous by his absence
He was fascinated with her beauty
He was jealous of their happiness
He was raised by his grandparents
He was unconscious for three days
He went to the hospital yesterday
He worked from morning till night
Her husband smokes like a chimney
Her mother is a wonderful pianist
His behavior is worthy of respect
His condition got worse every day
His house is somewhere about here
His house was struck by lightning
His sleeve touched the greasy pan
His speech impressed us very much
His speech was not altogether bad
I am looking forward to Christmas
I appreciate what you did earlier
I asked myself that same question
I asked the doctor some questions
I captured butterflies with a net
I confessed to stealing the money
I constantly quarrel with my wife
I cut myself shaving this morning
I did nothing during the holidays
I did something I regretted doing
I explained the procedures to him
I felt my heart beating violently
I finally found out what happened
I found a good Mexican restaurant
I have already changed my clothes
I have decided to learn shorthand
I have eight brothers and sisters
I have enjoyed reading this novel
I have just finished eating lunch
I have just returned from Britain
I have little interest in history
I have not finished breakfast yet
I have visited Boston three times
I just graduated from high school
I just started to learn Esperanto
I learned a valuable lesson today
I like to study foreign languages
I love old prewar gangster movies
I may not be completely objective
I myself will repair that machine
I never imagined meeting you here
I never really knew what happened
I never thought that would happen
I prefer working to doing nothing
I reached the village before dark
I really appreciate all your help
I remember everything you tell me
I remember hearing the story once
I remember one poem in particular
I sometimes hear rumors about her
I spent all morning chopping wood
I still have trouble believing it
I succeeded because of his advice
I suggest we change clothes first
I support you one hundred percent
I think you might be overreacting
I thought the questions were easy
I thought we had an understanding
I thought your house was downtown
I value your friendship very much
I was astonished by his ignorance
I was present at school yesterday
I was totally unprepared for this
I watch television before I study
I will come tomorrow without fail
I will play tennis this afternoon
I wonder what Tom actually thinks
I wonder whose these scissors are
I would rather die than surrender
It cost less than fifteen dollars
It could just be your imagination
It has been raining since Tuesday
It is warmer today than yesterday
It seems that he knows everything
It was just a passing infatuation
Italy is a very beautiful country
I’ll introduce you to my mother
Job security became a major worry

My grandfather is in his nineties
My ideas are different from yours
My parents are very old fashioned
My primary concern is your safety
My sister usually walks to school
My upper right wisdom tooth hurts
My wife is obsessed with cleaning
My younger brother is watching TV
No meal is complete without bread
No medicine can cure this disease
Nobody is paying attention to Tom
Noh is a traditional Japanese art
Not all teachers behave like that
Not all the students were present
Not everybody knows about my plan
Not everything is black and white
Opposition to the bill was strong
Our school library has many books
Our troops engaged with the enemy
Our uncle bought us movie tickets
Paper was first invented in China
Peel the potatoes and the carrots
People are playing near the beach
People came to like her paintings
People grow more cynical with age
People notice every move he makes
Phoenix is the capital of Arizona
Place the ladder against the wall
Playing go is my favorite pastime
Please feel free to ask questions
Please help yourself to the fruit
Please help yourself to the salad
Please make yourself at home here
Please put on your safety glasses
Please stop playing with your hat
Please take good care of yourself
Rain is forecast for this evening
Raise your hand before you answer
Scott was a contemporary of Byron
See that this never happens again
She answered my letter right away
She begged for something to drink
She can speak English pretty well
She carried that table by herself
She decided to have the operation
She decorated her room with roses
She described the scene in detail
She devoted her life to education
She entered this school last year
She fell unconscious to the floor
She felt something touch her neck
She gave him everything she owned
She gave me some practical advice
She had a narrow escape yesterday
She has a distinct English accent
She has a very strong personality
She has been busy since yesterday
She has no opinion about religion
She helped me out countless times
She intended to become an actress
She is apparently an honest woman
She is more pretty than beautiful
She is traveling around the world
She is working hard this semester
She kept silent about the problem
She learned her part very quickly
She looks beautiful in that dress
She made cookies for the children
She must have been very beautiful
She ordered the book from England
She practices the piano every day
She presented him with the trophy
She should be charged with murder
She should have been more careful
She stared at him in astonishment
She translated that word for word
She turned against her old friend
She visited her husband in prison
She walked around looking for him
She was accompanied by her mother
She was engaged as an interpreter
She was never disrespectful to me
She was satisfied with the result
She was successful in the attempt
She watched him drawing a picture
She would not disclose the secret
Smoke was rising from the chimney

We need to get out of here
We now know that was a lie
We see what we want to see
We want to go to the beach
You and I are the same age
You can go there in a boat
You did what you had to do
You ought to do it at once
A book is lying on the desk
A dove is a symbol of peace
A haiku is one type of poem
A part of this land is mine
A pound is a unit of weight
A white dove is on the roof
Be sure not to eat too much
Give me a copy of this book
He asked me if I were happy
He begged us to go with him
He decided to give it a try
He did not know what to say
He did not know where to go
He did the work in two days
He does not have to do this
He does not watch TV at all
He flew a kite with his son
He got a loan from the bank
He got lost on his way here
He has a crush on this girl
He has a good ear for music
He has been sick for a week
He has my fate in his hands
He has to be taller than me
He is a head taller than me
He is an old friend of mine
He is as tall as his father
He is giving me a hard time
He is more clever than I am
He is much taller than I am
He is no match for his wife
He is not much of an artist
He is one of my old friends
He is rarely in a good mood
He is sure to pass the exam
He is the taller of the two
He is unfit to be a teacher
He knows how to drive a car
He left his keys in the car
He lost his way in the snow
He sat down to read a novel
He seems to have told a lie
He talks as if he were rich
He threw a stone at the dog
He told me his name was Tom
He took her out for a drive
He wants to go out with her
He was born to be a painter
He will be back in a second
Help me and I will help you
Her eyes remind me of a cat
Her garden is a work of art
His garden is a work of art
I also had a very good time
I am dying for a cold drink
I am dying to see her again
I am loved by all my family
I am on good terms with him
I am proud to work with you
I am working on my new book
I am yours and you are mine
I asked Tom if he knew Mary
I believe I am in the right
I can prove that I am right
I can talk to him for hours
I can teach you how to cook
I can teach you how to pray
I can teach you how to sing
I can teach you how to swim
I did the job in three days
I do like the way you think
I do not feel like doing it
I do not have any more time
I do not remember any of it
I do want to be your friend
I feel like going on a trip
I felt bad about what I did
I forgot the key to my room
I gave him what money I had
I gave it to the little boy
I gave my father a silk tie
I get dizzy when I stand up
I get hives when I eat eggs
I got a shave and a haircut
I had a good opinion of her
I had a phone call from him
I had a problem with my car
I had no choice but to come
I had no choice but to stay
I had nothing to do with it
I had to call off the party
I had to get away from here
I had to go to the hospital
I hate to see you like this
I have a ringing in my ears
I have lots of things to do
I have no funds in the bank
I have no home to return to
I have no idea how it works
I have no idea where we are
I have to decide what to do
I have to talk to you alone
I heard a knock at the door
I hope that he will help me
I hope you have a good trip
I just want this to be over
I just want to go to heaven
I just want to go to school
I just want to talk to them
I just want you to be happy
I know where we can get one
I know you want to help him
I like the way you treat me
I like to fish in the river
I live in a two story house
I lost my way in the forest
I love her and she loves me
I met an old friend of mine
I must help her at any cost
I must make up for the loss
I need to jump start my car
I need to keep my eyes open
I need to search for my pen
I only took a bite of bread
I plan to stay there a week
I ran as quickly as I could
I really do just want to go
I really want you to hug me
I refuse to give up on this
I rent a car from my friend
I rented a boat by the hour
I saw a girl with long hair
I shook my head and said no
I slept the rest of the day
I still need to talk to Tom
I still need to talk to you
I swim in the sea every day
I talked to her for an hour
I think I know where Tom is
I think Tom is going to die
I think of you all the time
I think that Tom lied to me
I think the same as they do
I think we have to tell Tom
I think we make a good team
I think you need to see him
I thought I knew what to do
I thought Tom had a day off
I threw a stone at the bird
I told Tom not to use those
I told her to come visit us
I told him to come visit us
I told you I could help you
I told you not to come here
I took a cab to the station
I took an arrow in the knee
I try not to think about it
I try to keep a low profile
I used to be a teacher here
I want a room with two beds
I want to buy a new bicycle
I want to buy my house back
I want to find my own place
I want to go home and sleep
I want to hear all about it
I want to keep my kids safe
I want to know what love is
I want to know what that is
I want to know who did that
I want to know who sent you
I want to know who they are
I want to lose a few pounds
I want to make you an offer
I want to see him very much
I want to share it with you
I want to sleep for a while
I want to stay in the house
I want to take the test now
I want to take you to lunch
I want to talk about it now
I want to talk to you alone
I want us not to get caught
I want us to do it together
I want us to make it happen
I want you both to get them
I want you out of my office
I want you to be my manager
I want you to be my partner
I want you to beg for mercy
I want you to dance with me
I want you to do this right
I want you to get some rest
I warned him not to be late
I was off duty at that time
I was told never to do that
I was too busy to write you
I was trying to talk to you
I will buy a car next month
I will not see him any more
I wish you a Happy New Year
I wish you had come with us
I wish you had told me that
I wish you the best of luck
I wish you were close to me
I wonder why he is so angry
I work out to stay in shape
I would like to go to Japan
I would like to go with you
It has been fine for a week
It is a nice view from here
It is a sheer waste of time
It is easy to work in jeans
It is time to shut the gate
It is unlike him to be late
It seemed to be a good idea
It seems to be a good house
It was the only thing to do
Just do what you have to do
Let me be the judge of that
Let me spell it out for you
Make it as spicy as you can
My dog is dreaming of a cat
My father made me what I am
My son is small for his age
My uncle gave his car to me
My wife is the boss at home
No man is wise at all times
No one can move the big box
No one is going to harm you
No one is going to hurt you
No one knows me like you do
Please give me a cup of tea
Please send it to me by fax
Rome was not built in a day
She asked him out on a date
She asked me if I could sew
She brought me a cup of tea
She did not walk to the gym
She gave him a lot of money
She made a mess of the work
She made a new suit for him
She owes him a lot of money
She took a sip of her drink
She urged him to do the job
She wants me to go with her
She was almost hit by a car
She was in time for the bus
Stay with us for a few days
Tell us how we may help you
Tell us what you want to do
That is what I want to know
The boy is tall for his age
The cap is too small for me
The choice is all up to you
The coat is too big for Tom
The guy with a beard is Tom
The man was bitten by a dog
The road came to a dead end
The roof of my house is red
There is a hole in his sock
There is a map on the table
There is no air on the moon
This bed is too soft for me
This is a new kind of melon
This is by far the best way
This is no time to be funny
This is the end of my story
This is the only one I have
This pond has a lot of carp
Tom asked me to go with him
Tom asked me why I was late
Tom can stay if he wants to
Tom had a knife in his hand
Tom had a smile on his face
Tom has a house with a pool
Tom has a scar on his cheek
Tom is a decent sort of guy
Tom is in a good mood today
Tom is not yet able to swim
Tom is the man of my dreams
Tom is the star of the show
Tom may not be able to come
Tom never said a word to me
Tom said it was on his desk
Tom told me a lot about you
Tom told me to stay at home
Tom took a bite of my apple
Tom wants me to go with him
We all want Tom to be happy
We are going to have a baby
We came by to wish you luck
We can talk in front of Tom
We have a lot to talk about
We have no choice but to go
We have no clue where he is
We have no idea where he is
We saw a castle ahead of us
We used to play in the park
We went to the park to play
What he said is a good idea
You are as white as a sheet
You can call us at any time
You can come if you want to
You have got a lot of nerve
You have only to ask for it
You have to go to the party
You just have to ask for it
You need to go to bed again
You need to help me do this
You only have to ask for it
You will have to work a lot
Your hand is as cold as ice
A bee flew out of the window
A black and white dog bit me
A hungry man is an angry man
A lot of trees were cut down
A rash broke out on her neck
A tree is known by its fruit
All of them will get a prize
All of us like you very much
Anyone can do it if they try
Anyone who says so is a liar
At least try to come on time
Both of them are in the room
Come home as soon as you can
Dust got into one of my eyes
Few people know how to do it
Give me the keys to your car
Have a look at the world map
He asked her if she knew him
He asked me to open the door
He asked me what my name was
He asked me who that man was
He asked the man to help him
He began to play an old song
He can run faster than I can
He carries a bag on his back
He cut the meat with a knife
He did both at the same time
He did not turn up after all
He did not want her to leave
He found a good place for me
He gave her a piece of paper
He gave me a piece of advice
He gave some milk to the cat
He goes to the office by car
He grew up to be an engineer
He had his son die last year
He had no friend to help him
He had the nerve to say that
He has come out of his shell
He has earned a lot of money
He has nothing to do with it
He has set up a new business
He hit his head on the shelf
He hung his jacket on a hook
He is a man of great ability
He is able to swim very fast
He is better than me at math
He is bound to win the match
He is going to run for mayor
He is just right for the job
He is known as a rock singer
He is likely to win the game
He is much smarter than I am
He is not at all a gentleman
He is not going to get ahead
He is one of my best friends
He is said to have died here
He is the oldest of them all
He is very eager to go there
He is what we call a pioneer
He is what we call a scholar
He is working on a new novel
He knows how to make a radio
He let me work in his office
He lost his way in the woods
He made me sing on the stage
He nodded to me as he passed
He put a stamp on the letter
He put the book on the shelf
He said that I must go there
He sat beside her on her bed
He seems to be a kind person
He seems to be a nice fellow
He set fire to his own house
He stuck the book in his bag
He told me that she was sick
He told me to meet him there
He told us to depart at once
He was able to pass the exam
He was able to read the book
He was killed by a land mine
He was not able to marry her
He was the first to help her
He was the first to help him
He was too busy to notice it
He wears a bow tie every day
He will come if you call him
Her skin is as white as snow
His new wife is about my age
His wish is to go to America
I added his name to the list
I advised Tom not to do that
I agree with you to a degree
I aimed my gun at the target
I am going to be an engineer
I am going to write a letter
I am proud of being a doctor
I am the leader of this team
I am used to driving a truck
I asked Tom not to bother us
I asked Tom to drive me home
I asked Tom to wait a minute
I asked Tom to wait a moment
I asked her to wait a minute
I asked him to drive me home
I asked him to leave at once
I came to wish you good luck
I can do more than just cook
I can look into this for you
I can show you a better time
I can teach you how to drive
I can teach you how to fight
I caught a cold two days ago
I dare you to prove me wrong
I did smoke when I was young
I do not love him any longer
I feel as if I were dreaming
I feel bad about what I said
I feel kind of sorry for Tom
I feel like I might throw up
I felt it was worth the risk
I felt like my life was over
I figured it was worth a try
I found him lying on the bed
I found this note on my door
I gave most of my money away
I gazed at the sea for hours
I got the book back from him
I grew up in this small town
I guess I could use a shower
I guess my luck just ran out
I guess that will have to do
I guess you want me to leave
I had a bad dream last night
I had a good time last night
I had a hard time getting in
I had a horrible day at work
I had no idea what to expect
I had nothing to do with her
I had quite a busy day today
I had sore legs the next day
I had things to take care of
I had to climb over the wall
I had to find out for myself
I had two copies of the book
I hate the sound of my voice
I have a black and white dog
I have a feeling he is right
I have a friend at City Hall
I have a good sense of smell
I have a question to ask you
I have an umbrella in my car
I have bought a lot of books
I have eaten a lot this week
I have many things to do now
I have no desire to hurt you
I have no friends to help me
I have no idea what you mean
I have no time to read books
I have not seen you for ages
I have nothing to do with it
I have nothing to say to you
I have some stamps in my bag
I have to buy some new shoes
I have to get away from here
I have to go to the bathroom
I have to study for the exam
I have to study for the test
I hear from him once a month
I hear he is good at mahjong
I heard it on the news today
I hope it will clear up soon
I hope that she will help me
I hope that you will help me
I hope that you will like it
I insist that we do this now
I just want to be his friend
I just want to hold her hand
I just want to say good luck
I just wanted to talk to you
I kept the seat warm for you
I knew then that I was right
I knew they were on the list
I knew we were going to lose
I know Tom is in great shape
I know how badly you want it
I know how much you love Tom
I know how this looks to you
I know none of the three men
I know the man you came with
I know what Tom likes to eat
I know why Tom is in trouble
I love the sound of her name
I love you with all my heart
I made you a pair of mittens
I may have to work part time
I meet him from time to time
I met him in Tokyo by chance
I must buy a new winter coat
I must make up for lost time
I need you for just a second
I never feed my dog raw meat
I never laid a finger on her
I only know what you tell me
I ought to do this by myself
I owe my success to her help
I owe my success to his help
I plan to tell Tom about you
I plan to write Tom a letter
I put some milk in my coffee
I read about it in the paper
I really need to talk to you
I said that I would help him
I saw a horse pulling a cart
I saw a town in the distance
I saw her just the other day
I saw the boy in brown shoes
I saw the man enter the room
I saw you at the flower shop
I see your cat in the garden
I should get back to my seat
I spent all day in his house
I still have some work to do
I suppose it was a bit silly
I talked him out of the idea
I think Tom is afraid of you
I think Tom is in his office
I think Tom wants to see you
I think he needs to go there
I think it will be hot today
I think she is a good dancer
I think what you say is true
I thought I was going to die
I thought Tom did a nice job
I thought it was a good idea
I thought we had a good time
I thought you were mad at me
I thought you were one of us
I told Tom he made a mistake
I told you I hate that shirt
I used to think no one cared
I waited for him for an hour
I want my share of the money
I want to ask you a question
I want to build a house here
I want to buy a new computer
I want to buy some ski boots
I want to come and live here
I want to get back to Boston
I want to go skiing with Tom
I want to go there once more
I want to kill you right now
I want to know all about you
I want to know what you mean
I want to take a closer look
I want to take you to dinner
I want to tell you the story
I want to want what you want
I want to work in a hospital
I want you to meet my cousin
I want you to read this book
I wanted to say hello to Tom
I was a student at that time
I was afraid to catch a cold
I was happy to hear the news
I was happy to see her again
I was just going to say that
I watched an old movie on TV
I will get in touch with you
I will go when he comes back
I wish I could help you more
I wish I could sing like Tom
I wish I had a better memory
I wish you were here with me
I would like a cup of coffee
I would like a word with you
I would like to go to France
I would love to try that out
I would very much like to go
I wrote my name on the paper
If you eat that you will die
It is about time I was going
It is easy to read this book
It is evident that he did it
It is going to be quite cold
It is not far from the hotel
It is time to feed the sheep
It is truly a nice day today
It is useless to talk to him
It looks like Tom is in love
It was just a matter of time
It would be stupid to say no
Keep in mind what I tell you
Let me bring you up to speed
Let me go and buy some bread
Life is like a game of chess
Listen to what I have to say
Mine is not so good as yours
My car broke down on the way
My cat is sleeping on my bed
My father has a lot of books
My father is too old to work
My father may be at home now
My wife had a baby last week
No one asked me to come here
No one else could do my work
No one ever saw such a thing
No one was on board the ship
No one would offer him a job
Please bring me a cup of tea
Please give me a cup of milk
See if the gas is turned off
Set a thief to catch a thief
She bought a toy for the kid
She did her best to help him
She gave birth to a baby boy
She has a book under her arm
She has a cottage by the sea
She has a flower in her hand
She has shown her room to me
She is almost as tall as you
She is engaged to a rich man
She laid her baby on the bed
She let him drive on his own
She spoke to me with a smile
She wants to go out with him
She went with him to the zoo
She will come if you ask her
Such a plan is bound to fail
Take care of the kids for me
Tell Tom to stay where he is
Tell Tom what you want to do
Tell me how to play the game
That book had a lot of pages
That is a pure waste of time
That is what we want to know
That old book is a real find
That was a crazy thing to do
The car was stuck in the mud
The cat is stuck in the tree
The chicken is a bit too dry
The dog should be on a chain
The duke holds a lot of land
The ice is too hard to crack
The man died a few hours ago
The word is no longer in use
There is a book on the table
There is a boy near the door
There is a castle in my town
There is a cat under the bed
There is a clock on the wall
There is a dog on the bridge
There is a knock at the door
There is a threat of a storm
There is going to be a storm
There was a cat on the table
There was no one left but me
There was no one to stop Tom
This bread is hard as a rock
This chair is too low for me
This hat is too tight for me
This house is too big for us
This is the only book I have
This is what we want to know
This tea is too hot to drink
This type of cat has no tail
Tom and Mary are at work now
Tom asked me not to help him
Tom asked me to cut his hair
Tom does not want to be late
Tom has a soft spot for Mary
Tom has been very good to me
Tom has no idea where we are
Tom is about as tall as Mary
Tom is almost as old as Mary
Tom is as tall as his father
Tom is at home with his wife
Tom is eager to talk to Mary
Tom is in need of a vacation
Tom is more famous than I am
Tom is very proud of his son
Tom knows that I lied to him
Tom likes to go to the beach
Tom owes Mary a lot of money
Tom put on his coat and left
Tom put the sign to the wall
Tom said Mary did a good job
Tom told them not to do that
Tom told us to take our time
Tom wants to go to the beach
Tom was like a brother to me
Tom was the one who found me
Tom will pay for what he did
Tom won a large sum of money
We are going to have a storm
We are in favor of your plan
We both want to go to Boston
We got off on the wrong foot
We got to the station at six
We have to give Tom a chance
We may as well start at once
We might be able to help her
We must make up for the loss
We see what we expect to see
We waited for him to turn up
We want you to sing the song
We went to the beach to swim
We were born on the same day
We will make up for the loss
You and I have the same idea
You are as tall as my sister
You are not a child any more
You can count on me any time
You can sit down if you want
You do seem a little on edge
You had better go to bed now
You have no right to be here
You have no right to do this
You know what you have to do
You may as well come with me
You must not go out at night
You said I could talk to Tom
You seem to be a kind person
You seem to be an honest man
A button has come off my coat
A doctor was sent for at once
A dog followed me to my house
A dolphin is a kind of mammal
A good idea came into my head
A good idea came into my mind
A good sweat will cure a cold
A new room was assigned to me
A red dress looks good on her
A rose has thorns on its stem
A yard is equal to three feet
All the boys are the same age
An android is a kind of robot
An eagle is flying in the sky
Any bed is better than no bed
Ask him if you have any doubt
Call me up when you get there
Do not take any notice of him
Eat your soup while it is hot
Give me a full glass of water
He accused me of being a liar
He asked for a drink of water
He asked me what I had bought
He believes that he is a hero
He bought a new pair of shoes
He brought me back in his car
He came back home a while ago
He can be proud of his father
He cut him short by saying no
He did his best to rescue her
He did it all out of kindness
He did what he promised to do
He died at the age of seventy
He found a ball in the garden
He gave her a piece of advice
He got a better score than us
He got out from under the car
He had no idea what to expect
He had to part with his house
He has a swelling on his head
He has enough money to buy it
He has fallen in love with me
He has no friend to play with
He has some money in the bank
He held on to my hand tightly
He hung a picture on the wall
He hurt his hand when he fell
He hurt his knee when he fell
He is a pioneer in this field
He is a teacher at our school
He is able to play the guitar
He is afraid that he will die
He is an ideal husband for me
He is an utter stranger to me
He is anxious for her to come
He is by far the best student
He is fed up with my problems
He is proud of being a doctor
He is the captain of the team
He is the image of his father
He is the tallest of all boys
He is too drunk to drive home
He is too dumb to fear danger
He left the book on the table
He let me work in this office
He made good use of the money
He made his son a wealthy man
He made me go against my will
He makes good use of his time
He often takes me for a drive
He ogled a girl outside a pub
He paid a visit to his friend
He plans to buy a new bicycle
He put on an air of innocence
He runs in the park every day
He said that he would help me
He stole a glance at the girl
He threw a rock into the pond
He told her that he loved her
He took a taxi to the station
He wanted it to be a surprise
He was a student at that time
He was accused of being a spy
He was all alone in the house
He was born in this very room
He was hurt in a car accident
He was kind enough to help me
He was looking for a good job
He was ready to face his fate
He was shown the photo by her
He was walking in front of me
He went out a few minutes ago
He went to New York on Monday
He will always be in my heart
He would be glad to hear that
Her car broke down on the way
Her coat is fur on the inside
Her hands were as cold as ice
His aim is to become a doctor
His wife is one of my friends
His wish was to go to America
I always pay the rent on time
I am a student of this school
I am a very good chess player
I am always ready to help you
I am growing to hate the girl
I am happy to hear your voice
I am looking for a good hotel
I am never at home on Sundays
I am sorry if I disturbed you
I am the tallest in our class
I am very glad school is over
I asked him what his name was
I bought it in a thrift store
I burned my hand with an iron
I came here hoping to see Tom
I can be there in ten minutes
I can hear you loud and clear
I care about you a great deal
I caught a bad cold last week
I closed my eyes to calm down
I decided not to go to Europe
I do hope you will come again
I do not mind what people say
I do not trust him any longer
I expect that he will help us
I fed the leftovers to my dog
I feel like I can do anything
I feel like taking a bath now
I feel the same way about you
I fell down and hurt my wrist
I forgave you a long time ago
I found your gloves in my car
I fully agree with all of you
I gave you what you asked for
I get off at the next station
I go by that church every day
I go for a walk every morning
I go to the movies every week
I got up early in the morning
I guess I need a little sleep
I guess both of us were lying
I had a good dream last night
I had a good sleep last night
I had good reasons to do that
I had intended to go with Tom
I had no idea you could dance
I had nothing to do with that
I had nothing to do with this
I had other things on my mind
I had such high hopes for you
I had to climb over the fence
I hate that you have to leave
I have a few minutes to spare
I have a little money with me
I have a pen pal in Australia
I have been busy for two days
I have enough money to buy it
I have lived here a long time
I have many coins in this box
I have money enough to buy it
I have my own bedroom at home
I have no friend to talk with
I have no idea how he escaped
I have no idea what to expect
I have no way of knowing that
I have not seen him in months
I have some good news for you
I have something I have to do
I have three more pages to go
I have to explain this to Tom
I have to look after this cat
I have to pay this bill today
I have to take the test again
I hear that he sold his house
I heard the news on the radio
I heard what Tom said to Mary
I hesitate to ask Tom to help
I hope Tom will be very happy
I hope Tom will get well soon
I hope that she listens to me
I hope you two are very happy
I hope you will get well soon
I hope you will soon get well
I just love to watch Tom play
I just want people to like me
I just want to be your friend
I just want to get some sleep
I just want to help you relax
I just want to know one thing
I just wanted Mary to love me
I just wanted to let you know
I kept an eye on her suitcase
I know Tom has gone to Boston
I know Tom wanted to meet you
I know every inch of New York
I know every inch of the town
I know my father will help me
I know that he went to London
I know that she has been busy
I know that you are a teacher
I know that you still love me
I know the whole of the story
I left my umbrella on the bus
I lied to you the other night
I like both of them very much
I like the sound of the piano
I like to finish what I start
I like to play music with Tom
I like to sleep on my stomach
I live about a mile from here
I lived in New York last year
I located the town on the map
I looked for a place to crash
I met Tom when I was thirteen
I met an old friend by chance
I met him on the previous day
I met my friend on the street
I might be a few minutes late
I must go to work early today
I must make an apology to her
I need to go feed the chicken
I need to write a book report
I never want to see him again
I never want to see you again
I never want us to be unhappy
I never was very good at math
I often get a letter from him
I opened a bottle of red wine
I plan to have lunch with him
I play tennis once in a while
I prefer not to talk about it
I prefer to not talk about it
I put my clothes in the dryer
I put my hand on his shoulder
I put some cream in my coffee
I put the money into the safe
I really have to be going now
I really like this wine a lot
I saw Tom going into the bank
I saw Tom going into the cave
I saw a house in the distance
I saw my mother hide the cake
I saw the moon above the roof
I saw them walking arm in arm
I see a bright future for you
I spent ten dollars on a book
I spoke with her for one hour
I suppose you want me to help
I take a bath every other day
I talk to myself all the time
I talked with her for an hour
I taught my wife how to drive
I think Tom had a good reason
I think Tom has a valid point
I think Tom has seen too much
I think our luck just ran out
I think our work here is done
I think this is going to work
I think we all know the rules
I think we may have a problem
I think we should make a deal
I think you know what I think
I think you need to leave now
I think you owe me some money
I thought it was a good movie
I told her that she was right
I told you I hated that shirt
I took care of my sick sister
I took it that you would come
I took your name off the list
I usually drink a lot of milk
I usually go to school by bus
I waited for him all day long
I want a volunteer to help me
I want him to play the guitar
I want to be in show business
I want to buy a dozen bananas
I want to focus on the future
I want to get better at chess
I want to get my ears pierced
I want to get there by subway
I want to get this done today
I want to go bowling with Tom
I want to go there once again
I want to go with you tonight
I want to know what to expect
I want to know what you think
I want to know where Tom went
I want to know where they are
I want to know who started it
I want to play chess with Tom
I want to see the movie again
I want to see you after lunch
I want to share this with you
I want to sleep a little more
I want to spend time with you
I want us to be friends again
I want you to be a bridesmaid
I want you to call the police
I want you to come back early
I want you to come right over
I want you to open the window
I wanted to hear you say that
I wanted to run away with Tom
I was caught in a traffic jam
I was caught in the rush hour
I was out of town on vacation
I was surprised to see a lion
I was tempted to call in sick
I went there by bus and train
I went to Boston to visit Tom
I went to the airport by taxi
I will be pleased to help you
I will call you within a week
I will find you a good doctor
I will pick you up around six
I will win the game next time
I wish I were a little taller
I wish you could come with us
I wonder if Tom is having fun
I wonder if maybe I should go
I wonder if you could help us
I wonder why Tom gave me this
I would like a glass of water
I would like to know her name
I would rather die than do it
I write in my diary every day
I write poems in my free time
It is clear that he is guilty
It is clear what must be done
It is fun to speak in English
It is going to rain all night
It is necessary for you to go
It is never too late to learn
It is no use arguing with him
It is no use asking him again
It is no use talking with him
It is rude to point at others
It is wrong to cheat at cards
It seems to run in the family
It was his job to gather eggs
It was snowing when I woke up
Japan is to the east of China
Lend me as much money you can
Let me kiss you one last time
Let me know what you find out
Let me make plain what I mean
Let me see what it looks like
Life is full of ups and downs
Life is not all fun and games
Lock the door when you go out
Madeira is the name of a wine
Mary had a flower in her hair
Mary has a flower in her hand
Mary is the girl of my dreams
Maybe I went a little too far
Money is the root of all evil
My best friend is in Rome now
My dad died before I was born
My dream is to become a pilot
My family is very proud of me
My father cut wood with a saw
My father had me wash the car
My father is going to kill me
My mother is a very good cook
My mother took me to the park
My uncle has a house in Italy
No one is allowed to go there
No one knew quite what to say
No one stops to listen to him
No one will give me any money
One is never too old to learn
School is not a waste of time
She asked him if he was happy
She called out to us for help
She can count from one to ten
She cut her hand with a knife
She found the key to my heart
She gave him a piece of paper
She gave him all of her money
She has a lot of friends here
She has a thing for older men
She held her baby in her arms
She is able to sing very well
She is as beautiful as a rose
She is no better than a thief
She met the man of her dreams
She must care for the old man
She pulled him out of the mud
She puts aside a lot of money
She says I need a fresh start
She told him that she was sad
She told me that she loved me
She took a taxi to the museum
She wants to live in the city
She wants to marry a rich man
She was on the verge of tears
She went out to buy some food
She will make him a good wife
She writes to me once a month
Sit down and rest for a while
Sit down to put your boots on
Stay and have a drink with us
Take a little nap on the sofa
Take as much time as you want
Take care and have a nice day
Take care not to catch a cold
Tell Tom that I need his help
Tell me what that man is like
Tell me when you will call me
That might not be a good idea
That old man is a fussy eater
That sounds like a lot of fun
That was then and this is now
The baby was crying to be fed
The box is too heavy to carry
The boy is afraid of the dark
The car came to a smooth stop
The girls are as busy as bees
The hotel is run by his uncle
The house by the lake is mine
The ice has melted in the sun
The old man is hard to please
The plane will get in on time
The ship is now in the harbor
The snow melted away in a day
The sun is shining in the sky
The war is going in our favor
There is a cat in the kitchen
There is a cat under the desk
There is a park near my house
There is an apple on the desk
There is no grass on the moon
There is no table in the room
They fear that he may be dead
They left the room one by one
They made a list of the names
They say that he is very rich
They wanted me out of the way
This car is used by my father
This is a little gift for you
This is an opera in five acts
This is how I met your mother
This is not going to end well
This is the boy who helped me
This is the life that I chose
This is where I draw the line
This room is too small for us
This soup is too salty to eat
Tom advised us not to do that
Tom found a job as a mechanic
Tom found no one in the house
Tom has to do that right away
Tom has to pay his rent today
Tom is a close friend of mine
Tom is a little angry at Mary
Tom is a year older than Mary
Tom is better than me at math
Tom is much smarter than I am
Tom is not much older than me
Tom is now very angry with me
Tom is the richest man I know
Tom is trying to get it right
Tom made himself a cup of tea
Tom might be able to fix that
Tom said he had a slight cold
Tom said he wanted to do more
Tom said you told him to wait
Tom stood in line for an hour
Tom talked to a lot of people
Tom told Mary to go back home
Tom told me that he was sorry
Tom walked as far as he could
Tom wanted to be part of that
Tom was found dead in his bed
Tom was one of the lucky ones
Tom was the life of the party
Tom went to Boston for a week
Tom won a free trip to Boston
Tom would help us if he could
Try and do it right this time
Try to see things as they are
We are badly in want of water
We are going to travel by car
We are not here to arrest you
We go fishing once in a while
We got there at the same time
We had a good time last night
We had to put off the meeting
We have no way to verify this
We have to get away from here
We just want to live in peace
We made fun of him about this
We must avoid war at all cost
We must make up for lost time
We need it now more than ever
We need our demands to be met
We need to get away from here
We showed them what we can do
We still have more work to do
We still have some work to do
We wanted to get out of there
We went on a really long walk
We were there for a long time
What he said may well be true
What you did to Tom was cruel
You are the tallest of us all
You are twice as strong as me
You can get it at a bookstore
You had a week to finish this
You have got to be kidding me
You have no right to go there
You have to do it by yourself
You have to eat before you go
You have to take in my jacket
You have to tell me the truth
You may as well leave at once
You may get it free of charge
You may sit down on the chair
You must make up for the loss
You must see it to believe it
You must take care of the dog
You need to find your own way
You need to sit down and rest
You never tell me you love me
You still have a lot to learn
You will soon get to like her
You will soon get to like him
Your guess is as good as mine
A bow is no use without arrows
A dairy cow is a useful animal
A dance will be held on Friday
A dead leaf fell to the ground
A dog followed me to my school
A fire broke out near my house
A fish leaped out of the water
A lot still remains to be done
A man called on you last night
A man came to see me yesterday
A new dress was bought for her
A red dress made her stand out
All good things come to an end
An ice pack will numb the pain
An ugly man knocked on my door
Ask Tom what we should do next
Ask her when he will come back
Be careful not to catch a cold
Come along with us if you like
Come down here and eat with us
Come here by ten at the latest
Dark clouds are a sign of rain
Each of them was given a prize
Get the bicycle out of the way
Give me a white piece of paper
Grab a broom and help us clean
Half the office took a day off
He acted the part of King Lear
He arrived as soon as he could
He asked a few questions of me
He asked me whether I was busy
He ate every bit of his dinner
He bet two pounds on the horse
He bought a new pair of gloves
He came close to losing an eye
He came to Berlin as a teacher
He came to Japan two years ago
He cut the rope with his teeth
He does not belong in the city
He flatly refused to let me in
He gave us the signal to begin
He gets a haircut once a month
He had decided on a new policy
He had his shirt on inside out
He had no luck in finding work
He has a head on his shoulders
He has a large number of books
He has a lot of original ideas
He has a son and two daughters
He has gone blind in both eyes
He has no friends to talk with
He has only six months to live
He heard the news on the radio
He helped me clean up the mess
He hit his head against a rock
He is a brave and cheerful boy
He is above doing such a thing
He is acting on his own behalf
He is afraid of his own shadow
He is anxious to go to America
He is anxious to read the book
He is known as a great painter
He is much older than he looks
He is subject to fits of anger
He is the least likely to come
He is the only child they have
He is the richest man on earth
He is to blame for the failure
He kept me waiting for an hour
He knows how to play the piano
He laid his head on the pillow
He likes to work in the garden
He made up his mind right away
He may come and see us tonight
He moved the desk to the right
He must be aware of the danger
He risked his life to save her
He said that you had better go
He saved money for his old age
He saw the surprise on my face
He seems to make nothing of it
He stayed in London for a time
He stood up for what was right
He threw a stone into the pond
He told her that she was right
He told me about it in private
He told me that you were right
He took me for my twin brother
He turned out to be her father
He wants to be a tennis player
He wants to work in a hospital
He warned me that I would fail
He was a man of great ambition
He was in America at that time
He was knocked over by the car
He was late to his own wedding
He was lying asleep in the sun
He was not aware of the danger
He was robbed of all his money
He was the envy of his friends
He was too drunk to drive home
He was too young to live alone
He went over to the other side
He went to Paris two years ago
He went to some place or other
He will be back in ten minutes
He will be coming to the party
He works with me at the office
He wrote a book while in China
Her belief in God is very firm
Her dream is to become a nurse
Her work is to wash the dishes
His ambition is to be a lawyer
His house is not far from here
His mother came to pick him up
His mother used to be a singer
His speech made no sense to me
His wife leads him by the nose
His work is not up to standard
Hold this while I tie my shoes
I advise you wear a heavy coat
I agree with him on that point
I agree with you on this point
I always try to tell the truth
I am going to America by plane
I am going to Europe next week
I am in favor of your proposal
I am not alone in this opinion
I am positive that he is wrong
I am suffering from a bad cold
I am sure that he will succeed
I am the happiest man on earth
I am the laziest person I know
I am tired of listening to Tom
I arrived on the night he left
I asked Tom to play the guitar
I asked Tom why he was unhappy
I asked him where he was going
I believe we can get that done
I believe you know what I mean
I can see myself in the mirror
I caught a glimpse of her face
I caught my finger in the door
I could have done it by myself
I do not like to make mistakes
I expect you know all about it
I feel awful about what I said
I feel like I know you already
I feel like a brand new person
I figured I could count on you
I flew from London to New York
I forgot to pay for the drinks
I gave up all hope of survival
I got bored with his long talk
I got off at the wrong station
I got the bicycle at a bargain
I got up at seven this morning
I grabbed a book off the shelf
I guess I have nothing to lose
I had a good time last evening
I had a good time playing golf
I had a good time this evening
I had a neighbor who was blind
I had a weird dream last night
I had been reading for an hour
I had business to take care of
I had hoped to save more money
I had hoped you might say that
I had my brother clean my room
I had my car stolen last night
I had my radio repaired by him
I had never seen so much money
I had no intention of doing so
I had to crawl under the fence
I had to get a molar extracted
I had to pay five more dollars
I hate to put you through this
I hate to see you so miserable
I have a letter written by him
I have a picture of an airport
I have a surprise for you guys
I have booked a table for four
I have just a few bullets left
I have never been to that town
I have no idea where she lives
I have nothing to fall back on
I have some good news to share
I have something for you to do
I have the house all to myself
I have to deal with this alone
I heard a noise in the bedroom
I heard him go down the stairs
I hope it was only an accident
I hope my dream will come true
I hope we can avoid doing that
I hope we can still be friends
I hope you had a great weekend
I hope you will answer me soon
I invited him over to my place
I just figured out who you are
I just had my final exam today
I just love that kind of stuff
I just need a little more time
I just want a little more time
I just want someone to talk to
I just want to forget about it
I just want you to be involved
I just want you to be prepared
I just wanted to go to college
I just wanted to help the team
I just wanted to say good luck
I just wanted to say thank you
I just wanted to wish you luck
I just wanted you to accept me
I just wanted you to know that
I knew every one of those guys
I know I have a biased opinion
I know every word on this page
I know how you must be feeling
I know that boy who is running
I know the name of this animal
I know what Tom is looking for
I know what Tom likes to drink
I know where you keep your gun
I know who lives in this house
I know you were born in Boston
I learned that a long time ago
I left my briefcase in the bus
I left my coat here last night
I like the melody of this song
I like things the way they are
I like to eat a late breakfast
I like to look at old pictures
I live in this house by myself
I looked it up on the Internet
I lost my camera the other day
I love the flowers you sent me
I love the people in this town
I love trying to do new things
I made that decision on my own
I missed the point of the joke
I missed the train by a minute
I myself have never seen a UFO
I need to get my oboe repaired
I need to get something to eat
I never get to see you anymore
I never thought of it that way
I nodded to show that I agreed
I only have six months to live
I paid him the money last week
I prefer that it stay that way
I read a lot of modern authors
I read a magazine to kill time
I really did have a great time
I really need to take a shower
I really see no reason to stay
I really think we need to talk
I really thought I could do it
I really want to know her name
I really want to see Tom today
I recommend you to go by train
I regarded the man as an enemy
I rode my bicycle to the store
I saw Tom at the funeral today
I showed my ticket at the door
I spent all day with my friend
I stayed up till late at night
I still have things left to do
I still need to buy some bread
I stuck my hands in my pockets
I suggest that you talk to Tom
I sure hope he passes the test
I take a bath almost every day
I think I can sing fairly well
I think I have a gum infection
I think Tom and Mary are right
I think Tom has made a mistake
I think Tom made a big mistake
I think Tom really is a doctor
I think Tom was born in Boston
I think about you all day long
I think about you all the time
I think both of them are right
I think perhaps I can help Tom
I think she is good at dancing
I think she made up that story
I think we can help each other
I think we made the right call
I think we should get out here
I think we should look into it
I think you might need my help
I think you would like it here
I thought I could deal with it
I thought I was going to faint
I thought we were going to die
I thought we were going to win
I told him not to throw stones
I told you I have a girlfriend
I took that picture a week ago
I took this picture a week ago
I unfolded the map on the desk
I urge everyone to do the same
I usually go to bed before ten
I waited a whole year for that
I walk in the forest every day
I walked as far as the station
I want it done within the hour
I want my children to be happy
I want them to be your friends
I want to be more than friends
I want to bring my family here
I want to buy something to eat
I want to do something for Tom
I want to fly above the clouds
I want to go swimming with Tom
I want to hear more about this
I want to know all the details
I want to know the whole story
I want to make my father proud
I want to make one thing clear
I want to make that very clear
I want to make you work harder
I want to remember all of this
I want to take advantage of it
I want to talk to your manager
I want to talk with your uncle
I want us to get back together
I want you to destroy all this
I want you to do some research
I want you to read this letter
I want you to stay here longer
I want you to think about this
I wanted to be a piano teacher
I wanted to tell you the truth
I was asked to fix the bicycle
I was asked to umpire the game
I was bored with his old jokes
I was born and raised in Tokyo
I was born during the Cold War
I was delayed by a traffic jam
I was fortunate to get the job
I was invited by an old friend
I was late because of the rain
I was taken in by the salesman
I was the one who suggested it
I was told to get enough sleep
I went to my bedroom and cried
I will always be there for you
I will go along with your plan
I will play the guitar for you
I wish I could buy that guitar
I wish I could give up smoking
I wish I could paint like that
I wish I had a million dollars
I wish she had come last night
I woke up at five this morning
I wonder if she will marry him
I wonder if that was the point
I wonder what Tom sees in Mary
I wonder which of you will win
I wonder why she is so worried
I wonder why we have ear lobes
I would be willing to help you
I would like a piece of cheese
I would like to ask a question
I would like to live in France
I would like to visit New York
I wrote a letter to my teacher
I wrote her a letter every day
I wrote this song just for you
It began to rain cats and dogs
It has been raining off and on
It has been snowing on and off
It has nothing to do with luck
It is certain that he is wrong
It is difficult to talk to him
It is no good talking about it
It is no use giving her advice
It is obvious that he is right
It is still fresh in my memory
It is too dark to play outside
It turned out that I was right
It was Tom that saved the girl
It was a dark and stormy night
It was fun playing in the park
It was merely a matter of luck
It was not clear what she said
Keep in mind that you must die
Keep the money in a safe place
Let me hear from you very soon
Let us never speak of it again
Life in a small town is boring
Look at those fish in the pond
Looks like I will become a dad
Luck had nothing to do with it
My brother did it on my behalf
My brother gave me a cute doll
My father goes to work by bike
My father has bought a new car
My father is in the garden now
My father made me a nice lunch
My father made me wash the car
My father might be at home now
My friend gave me a silk scarf
My husband is a very good cook
My poor English cost me my job
My son likes to play with cars
Never have I seen such a thing
No one I know buys CDs anymore
No one knew who owned the land
No one spoke up in his defense
No one wanted to talk about it
Now he has nothing to live for
Please add my name to the list
Please call me back in an hour
Please do not try this at home
Please give me a cup of coffee
Please let me know if it hurts
Please show me what to do next
Please take the pants in a bit
Pour a little wine in my glass
Pull the plant up by the roots
Put it back where you found it
Put the book back where it was
Put the pliers in the tool box
Ring the bell when you want me
She accused me of being a liar
She advised him not to do that
She advised him to take a rest
She asked how to cook the fish
She asked me where I was going
She bought a toy for her child
She cut the apple with a knife
She did her best to rescue him
She earns a living as a writer
She gave him all of her silver
She got up to answer the phone
She had a happy time with them
She has fallen in love with me
She has quite a lot of clothes
She is a woman of great beauty
She is aware of my secret plan
She is certain to come on time
She is very afraid of the dark
She is what we call a bookworm
She likes to go to the library
She looks as if she were drunk
She put on an air of innocence
She said she had a slight cold
She said that it might be true
She told him that he was right
She took him for all his money
She wants him to be her friend
She warned him not to go alone
She was afraid to catch a cold
She was kind enough to help me
She was on the verge of crying
She was ready to face her fate
She went to the museum by taxi
She will always be in my heart
She will be back within a week
She will not stick to her word
Take a little nap on the couch
Tell me what has become of him
Tell me what you did in Hawaii
Tell the maid to make the beds
That has nothing to do with it
That is the duty of the police
That man has a very good build
That sword is fit for a prince
That was a sight for sore eyes
That was a total waste of time
The boy got lost in the forest
The boy was afraid of the dark
The car raised a cloud of dust
The cat was basking in the sun
The chair is close to the door
The chair is far from the door
The cost of living has gone up
The director is away on a trip
The dog can bring back a stick
The dog followed me to my home
The door must not be left open
The earth is where we all live
The end of the world is coming
The house is in need of repair
The lion is the king of beasts
The month is drawing to an end
The phone rang for a long time
The question is who will do it
The sea was as smooth as glass
The sky is full of dark clouds
The store is close to my house
The storm raged for a few days
The tines of the fork are bent
The tire on my bicycle is flat
The writer is well known to us
There are a lot of people here
There are seven days in a week
There are some eggs in the box
There is an album on the shelf
There is an apple on the table
There is no chair in this room
There is no future in this job
There is one apple on the desk
There used to be a bridge here
There used to be a church here
There used to be a prison here
There was no place to buy food
These shoes are too big for me
They bought a home with a pool
They kicked Tom out of the bar
They told me it was your fault
They will help you to get warm
This box will serve as a table
This desk is too heavy to lift
This is a violation of the law
This is by far the best method
This is hard for me to believe
This is how it has always been
This is one of the basic rules
This is the cheaper of the two
This is twice as large as that
This is what I was looking for
This is what I was waiting for
This seems too good to be true
This table is made out of wood
This was his one and only hope
Tom acted the part of a sailor
Tom also has a house in Boston
Tom and I used to be neighbors
Tom and Mary agreed on a price
Tom and Mary are a nice couple
Tom does all his work at night
Tom eats a lot of Chinese food
Tom has a high opinion of Mary
Tom has begun to look for work
Tom has forgotten how to do it
Tom has never been to a circus
Tom hurt his knee when he fell
Tom is a hard person to please
Tom is a lot shorter than Mary
Tom is eager to live in Boston
Tom is going to need your help
Tom is in better shape than me
Tom is madly in love with Mary
Tom is not a very friendly guy
Tom is out of town on business
Tom is richer than most of you
Tom is taking care of the kids
Tom is too young to drink beer
Tom is waiting at the bus stop
Tom is working on it right now
Tom left Mary alone in the car
Tom left his keys on the table
Tom lied about a lot of things
Tom lost three sons in the war
Tom made me go against my will
Tom never came out of his coma
Tom put the coins into the box
Tom said he tried to kiss Mary
Tom seems to have lost his key
Tom told Mary that it was over
Tom told me he was really busy
Tom told me that he was lonely
Tom told me to be more careful
Tom told me you were in Boston
Tom took a long drink of water
Tom tried to open the car door
Tom wants to come to our party
Tom wants to try a new shampoo
Tom was afraid to go back home
Tom was found dead in his room
Tom was here just a moment ago
Tom was just telling me a joke
Tom was lucky to find his keys
Tom went to the park with Mary
Turn him down once and for all
We can still get there on time
We climbed right up to the top
We had a lot of rain yesterday
We had a mild winter last year
We had a very good time indeed
We have not yet begun to fight
We have to do better next time
We hope to do better this week
We must keep a diary every day
We need a knife for the butter
We need to do better than this
We need to find Tom right away
We need to make a big decision
We need you back in the office
We really have a lot in common
We saved you a seat right here
We see each other once a month
We shared the cost of the meal
We still have a few hours left
We think we are over the worst
We took a walk along the river
We used to play games like tag
We want to have a large family
We went into the red last year
We went to the mountain to ski
We were just about to call you
What I need worst is a haircut
Yesterday I hit on a good idea
You are not to leave this room
You can bet your boots on that
You can come along if you want
You can trust him with any job
You had better not drive a car
You have a good sense of humor
You have more energy than I do
You have no need to be ashamed
You must take care of your dog
You need to take a cold shower
You need to tell Tom the truth
You owe me an apology for that
You should not do such a thing
You should not wear a fur coat
You should tell Tom what to do
You were right and I was wrong
You will always be in my heart
You will not get there on time
Your ideas are all out of date
A bee sting can be very painful
A car went by at terrific speed
A card was attached to the gift
A child today would not do that
A fish swims by moving its tail
A full moon can be seen tonight
A good appetite is a good sauce
A good idea came across my mind
A penny saved is a penny earned
A young person wants to see you
All at once the lights went out
All at once they began to laugh
All men are equal under the law
All the exams are now behind us
All the guys teased me about it
All the students look up to him
All this is for my personal use
And now a word from our sponsor
Ask her how much soup she wants
Ask her when she will come back
Ask him where he parked his car
Belgium is not as big as France
Both my parents are at home now
Call me when you get settled in
Close your eyes and go to sleep
Do not give in to those demands
Do your best in anything you do
Few girls can even speak to him
Get it done as soon as possible
Guess what I found on the beach
Guess what I want to talk about
He asked if I like Chinese food
He asked me for my phone number
He behaves as if he were insane
He buried his head in his hands
He came in spite of bad weather
He denied that he knew that man
He denied that he was the thief
He did not work on Sunday night
He did what I wanted right away
He differs from me in some ways
He does not live there any more
He dropped the cup and broke it
He fixed the problem in a jiffy
He forgot to turn off the light
He gets hives when he eats eggs
He had a second helping of soup
He has a daughter who is pretty
He has a natural bent for music
He has an estate in the country
He has been dead for five years
He has been very busy this week
He has been waiting for an hour
He has many tenants on his land
He has no friends to advise him
He has no hope of getting ahead
He has started to write a novel
He held on firmly to the branch
He helped the lady into the car
He hit the ball with his racket
He hit two birds with one stone
He hung a lamp from the ceiling
He inserted the key in the lock
He intends to buy a new bicycle
He is a good speaker of English
He is a member in good standing
He is a member of the committee
He is about to leave for London
He is always at home on Mondays
He is getting better bit by bit
He is not ashamed of being poor
He is proud of being a musician
He is related to me by marriage
He is taller than any other boy
He is the happiest man on earth
He is very afraid of his mother
He keeps on asking me for money
He kept a diary during the trip
He kicked him while he was down
He left his son a large fortune
He likes to cook for his family
He likes to sing in the bathtub
He lived to be eighty years old
He lives all alone in the woods
He lives far away from my house
He lives in a cozy little house
He lost his life in an accident
He made believe he was a doctor
He may be able to come tomorrow
He must be stopped at all costs
He ordered me to sweep the room
He owes his wealth to good luck
He paused to look at the poster
He placed the book on the shelf
He prefers not to talk about it
He put his hand to his forehead
He put his hands in his pockets
He put his things down and left
He replied that he did not know
He said we must keep the secret
He seems to have lived in Spain
He stood aside for her to enter
He suspects me of telling a lie
He told me to speak more slowly
He took me for everything I had
He took what little money I had
He tried it over and over again
He tried to hold back his anger
He tried to keep back his tears
He was impatient to see his son
He was killed by a blunt weapon
He was killed in a car accident
He was kind enough to invite me
He was late because of the snow
He was right to give up smoking
He was taken in by the salesman
He was the one who suggested it
He was tired from his long walk
He was too embarrassed to do it
He was walking ahead of the car
He went to London two years ago
He went to New York on business
He went to stay with his cousin
He will be delighted to see you
He wiped his nose on his sleeve
He wiped the sweat off his face
He works as hard as any student
He works in a big city hospital
Her dream has come true at last
Her story turned out to be true
His house is there on the right
His story turned out to be true
Hope to see you again next year
I accepted that a long time ago
I agree with you to some extent
I agreed with him on that point
I always wanted to be a teacher
I always wanted to go to Boston
I am afraid I ate something bad
I am going on a picnic tomorrow
I am going to the swimming pool
I am not always free on Sundays
I am not in the least surprised
I am relieved that you are safe
I am sorry to have troubled you
I am very sensitive to the cold
I appreciate what he did for me
I believe what you said is true
I believed that he was a doctor
I bought a camera the other day
I can get us there more quickly
I checked the time on the clock
I come from a family of doctors
I could eat this for every meal
I could really get used to this
I did not read a book yesterday
I doubt the truth of the report
I dreamed I was in Boston again
I drove the car into the garage
I enjoy looking at my old diary
I expect to be back next Monday
I expected him to fail the exam
I expected you home an hour ago
I feel a lot better than before
I feel great and I feel healthy
I feel like having an ice cream
I feel like singing in the rain
I figured I might find you here
I filled up the vase with water
I first met him three years ago
I forgot my credit card at home
I forgot to buy a birthday cake
I gave her just what she needed
I get asked that question a lot
I got here a little early today
I got up very late this morning
I guess I could use some advice
I guess I could use the company
I guess I just got carried away
I guess that she is over thirty
I guess that would be all right
I guess we were happy back then
I guess you must be very hungry
I had a chance to travel abroad
I had a very good day yesterday
I had bought it the week before
I had no idea you were involved
I had something else on my mind
I had to see a doctor yesterday
I hate the color of these walls
I have a bad feeling about this
I have bruises all over my body
I have enough money to buy this
I have hardly any money with me
I have lived here for ten years
I have lost all respect for you
I have lost my new fountain pen
I have no proof to the contrary
I have nothing more to do today
I have nothing to report so far
I have nothing to say right now
I have to finish what I started
I heard her singing in her room
I heard the song sung in French
I hope that it is fine tomorrow
I hope you stop telling me lies
I hope your wish will come true
I just got back three hours ago
I just got bitten by a mosquito
I just want things to be normal
I just want to do something fun
I just want us to stay together
I just want what I was promised
I just wanted to check my email
I just wanted to make a gesture
I just wanted us to be together
I keep my hammer in the toolbox
I knew it would be an adventure
I knew this was going to happen
I knew what was going to happen
I know exactly what I should do
I know somebody who can help us
I know someone who can help you
I know what you were hoping for
I learned not to ignore my pain
I left my calculator on my desk
I left my gloves in the library
I left my guitar in your office
I left part of the meal uneaten
I left the keys in the ignition
I like being part of this group
I like him because he is honest
I like hot tea better than cold
I like to be with my classmates
I like to swim in the afternoon
I lived in Sanda City last year
I locked myself out of my house
I love the view from my balcony
I miss my family and my country
I miss my family and my friends
I must hand in the report today
I must know the truth about him
I must learn this poem by heart
I need it for the parking meter
I need that as soon as possible
I never said it would be simple
I never said that I wanted that
I never spoke to him after that
I never thought I would do that
I never thought Tom could do it
I never want to leave you again
I no longer want to hurt anyone
I often hear her play the piano
I often think of my dead mother
I paid for the purchase in cash
I paid ten dollars for this cap
I plan on being there in person
I play guitar in an oldies band
I prefer a hotel by the airport
I prefer not to discuss it here
I prefer red wine to white wine
I read your letter to my family
I really see no reason to leave
I really want to hold your hand
I refuse to obey you any longer
I remember when I first saw you
I sat down and opened my laptop
I saw a boy crossing the street
I saw a cottage in the distance
I saw a dog crossing the street
I saw you in the park yesterday
I seem to have the wrong number
I share the room with my sister
I still find it hard to believe
I suppose you know all about it
I think Tom is hiding from Mary
I think Tom is pulling your leg
I think Tom may be mentally ill
I think Tom was looking for you
I think maybe that was my fault
I think my German is really bad
I think we should all go inside
I think you did the right thing
I think you should grow a beard
I think you should listen to me
I think you should see a doctor
I thought you could use a break
I thrust my hand into my pocket
I told him what the problem was
I told you to sign the document
I took his side in the argument
I tried to tell you this before
I walked in the woods by myself
I want him to solve the problem
I want people to know the truth
I want these people out of here
I want things the way they were
I want this garbage out of here
I want to go to America someday
I want to make my parents proud
I want to sleep a little longer
I want to speak to your manager
I want to talk about the future
I want to talk to your superior
I want you to keep your promise
I want you to stop following me
I wanted to learn from the best
I was able to solve the problem
I was at home all day yesterday
I was beginning to lose my cool
I was impressed with what I saw
I was in the hospital last week
I was just trying to be helpful
I was kicked out of high school
I was never a very good athlete
I was the happiest man on earth
I was too afraid to do anything
I was too scared to do anything
I was writing her a love letter
I went swimming after I woke up
I went through a lot of trouble
I went to Europe before the war
I will advise you on the matter
I will do anything that you ask
I will go with you if necessary
I will keep your advice in mind
I will show you around the city
I wish I could be more specific
I wish my dream would come true
I wish you could stay the night
I wish you success in your work
I wonder if Tom has another one
I wonder if anybody can help us
I wonder if this is really true
I wonder if you are truly happy
I wonder what I should do today
I wonder what Tom thought of it
I wonder what ear lobes are for
I wonder what has become of her
I would like to charter a yacht
I would like to meet his father
I would sooner die than give up
I would tend to agree with that
If only I had taken your advice
In life there are ups and downs
It fits on a single floppy disk
It is difficult for me to skate
It is getting warmer day by day
It is really quite a good story
It is said the house is haunted
It makes a big difference to me
It rained for three days on end
It seems that he knows about it
It was a bitter pill to swallow
It was an ideal day for walking
It was bound to happen some day
It was not easy to convince him
It would be nice to get married
Just tell Tom to leave me alone
Keeping a diary is a good habit
Let me give you my phone number
Let me help you clear the table
Let me help you with the dishes
Long hair is out of fashion now
Look at that pole in the square
Look at the picture on the wall
Many friends came to see me off
Mary is as pretty as her sister
Mary is the prettier of the two
Mary really is a very cute girl
Maybe he will be a good teacher
Mom bought a pretty doll for me
Mother and I were in the garden
My aunt is older than my mother
My bicycle is in need of repair
My dad died when I was thirteen
My dog follows me wherever I go
My dream is to become a teacher
My family is not all that large
My father drives a very old car
My father is very angry with me
My home is close to the station
My mother cut my hair too short
My mother is not always at home
My mother made a sweater for me
My mother was sick for two days
My office is on the fifth floor
My parents call me up every day
My parents want me to come home
My sister is a very good typist
My wife is away for the weekend
My wife wanted to adopt a child
Next week a family will move in
No one can match him in English
No one could tell where she was
No one had anything left to say
No one lets me have fun anymore
No one seems to know the answer
No one was in the swimming pool
No one will vote for the budget
None of us are against his idea
Not all of us can speak English
Oranges have a lot of vitamin C
Our new head office is in Tokyo
Please bear in mind what I said
Please do not walk on the grass
Please give me a glass of water
Please give me a piece of bread
Please give me a sheet of paper
Please put it back in its place
Please put your age on the form
Please stay as long as you wish
Poverty is the root of all evil
Prices are about to go up again
Put the book where you found it
Say hello to your father for me
Say hello to your sister for me
She accused me of telling a lie
She advised him to see a lawyer
She asked him to call her later
She asked him why he was crying
She asked me to open the window
She can swim further than I can
She cleaned her room in a hurry
She did nothing but cry all day
She dumped him for a richer man
She fell down and hurt her knee
She gave me a fake phone number
She got off at the next station
She had a basket full of apples
She had nothing to say about it
She had the kindness to help me
She has a scarf around her neck
She is certain to pass the exam
She is expecting a baby in June
She is looking for her car keys
She is two years older than you
She lived with him all her life
She looked him right in the eye
She looks a lot like her mother
She put her elbows on her knees
She risked her life to save him
She said she must leave at once
She said she would be back soon
She sang a Japanese song for us
She saw him driving his new car
She saw many animals on the way
She tends to be late for school
She thought that I was a doctor
She told him that she loved him
She told him that she was happy
She told us the road was closed
She took the taxi to the museum
She tried in vain to please him
She waited for him to come home
She wants to work in a hospital
She was a pioneer in this field
She was amazed to hear the news
She was born in a small village
She was nearly hit by a bicycle
She was on the point of leaving
She was very happy with my gift
She went with him to the movies
She will give a party next week
She will have a baby next month
She wrote a book about the bird
She wrote about it in her diary
Show me how much money you have
Smell is one of the five senses
Sometimes I see him at the club
Stay here all night if you want
Take your coat in case it rains
Tell me the object of your plan
Thank you for coming to meet me
Thank you for making it so easy
Thank you so much for coming by
That has nothing to do with him
That is how he always treats me
That is not exactly what I said
That man stole all of his money
That song reminds me of my home
That sounds too good to be true
That was just icing on the cake
The bank was held up last night
The bicycle by the door is mine
The boss said that we are fired
The boy threw stones at the dog
The child was hiding in the box
The dog seems to have been sick
The dog was sleeping on the mat
The dogs bayed at the full moon
The fire was on the first floor
The first round is on the house
The house is said to be haunted
The key was nowhere to be found
The kite got caught in the tree
The little boy said hello to me
The machine takes a lot of room
The noise will wake the baby up
The nurses were very nice to me
The old couple sat side by side
The old man begged me for money
The old man is angry and bitter
The pain in my stomach has gone
The plane was about to take off
The plane will take off at five
The present time is a good time
The problem was too much for me
The rent is paid for six months
The rest of them will come soon
The road is too narrow for cars
The room was in a perfect order
The storm raged in all its fury
The story was in all the papers
The sun gives us light and heat
The tower can be seen from here
The train came to a smooth stop
The two of us are finally alone
The whole town was in an uproar
There are many rats on the ship
There are no tables in the room
There are six apples in the box
There are some pears in the box
There is an orange on the table
There is no film in this camera
There is no shame in being poor
There is no wine in that bottle
There may be a problem with Tom
There may be some truth to this
There was a bottle of wine left
They accused me of being a liar
They are willing to help us out
They had no idea what to expect
They often make fun of the boss
They were afraid of the big dog
They would like to stay at home
This book goes on the top shelf
This book has a lot of pictures
This book should help you a lot
This doctor is a man of culture
This is a photograph of my home
This is going to be a challenge
This is just between you and me
This jacket is a little too big
This mouse was killed by my cat
This one is similar to that one
This stone is too heavy to lift
This truck is in need of repair
This will do for the time being
Today is our last day of school
Tom allowed his dog to run free
Tom and Mary broke up last week
Tom and Mary fight all the time
Tom and Mary got into their car
Tom asked Mary if she loved him
Tom asked Mary why she was late
Tom assigned Mary to do the job
Tom gave Mary half of the apple
Tom got there long after we did
Tom had a package under his arm
Tom had every right to be angry
Tom handed Mary a cup of coffee
Tom has a lot of valuable books
Tom has a warped sense of humor
Tom has decided to sell his car
Tom has no idea what that means
Tom is a former student of mine
Tom is a perfect stranger to me
Tom is always open to new ideas
Tom is always trying to be cool
Tom is deeply in love with Mary
Tom is going to cross the river
Tom is much older than he looks
Tom is much taller than you are
Tom is not playing by the rules
Tom is one of my oldest friends
Tom is the tallest in his class
Tom is too tired to do anything
Tom is writing a letter to Mary
Tom just wants to be left alone
Tom lives on the floor above me
Tom must be aware of the danger
Tom poured Mary a cup of coffee
Tom said you were good at chess
Tom says he has nothing to hide
Tom says that he hates to study
Tom shut the door and locked it
Tom still wants you to help him
Tom thought he was going to die
Tom told Mary to tell the truth
Tom took a couple of steps back
Tom took a taxi to the hospital
Tom wants to buy a Japanese car
Tom was sick in bed last Sunday
Tom was stretched out on a sofa
Tom went to high school with me
Tom will always be here for you
Tom will be here any minute now
Tom will be in Boston next year
Tom will know what we should do
Tom would never do that to Mary
Two sheep were killed by a wolf
We asked him what he was called
We can see his house over there
We gave blood to help the child
We had fine weather on that day
We have lunch at noon every day
We have plenty of time to spare
We have to deal with that first
We have to get something to eat
We have to keep working on that
We heard a noise in the bedroom
We managed to get there on time
We met them at the youth hostel
We might need to sell our house
We must go to bed early tonight
We need to come to an agreement
We need to do this report again
We need to make a slight detour
We saw a castle in the distance
We set up our tents before dark
We sometimes go out for a drive
We stood at the door and waited
We talk to each other every day
We want to know where you stand
We want to make a simple change
We want to thank you for coming
We wanted to wish you good luck
We went back to the living room
We went to the mountains to ski
We went to the museum last week
We went to the same high school
We were expecting a lot of snow
Whoever told you that is a liar
You are old enough to know this
You came at just the right time
You can do whatever you want to
You can only smoke on the patio
You could come and live with me
You had better do what they say
You had better not eat too much
You have gone too far this time
You know quite a lot about Sumo
You must not be late for school
You must return the book to him
You must teach me what you know
You need not have come so early
You ought not to have done that
You really should buy a new car
You should have done it with us
You stick out like a sore thumb
Your dog is still barking at me
Your mother is going to kill me
A baby is sleeping in the cradle
A big wave turned over his canoe
A coat is an article of clothing
A coin dropped out of his pocket
A curfew was imposed on the city
A driver was sleeping in the car
A few people came to the lecture
A good book is a great companion
A plane is flying above the city
A ring and some cash are missing
A rope was thrown into the water
A woman without a man is nothing
All her money went to her nephew
All we need is a little patience
Almost all of the dogs are alive
Ask at the police box over there
Be careful not to drink too much
Be careful on your way back home
Be careful when you cross a road
Both Tom and Mary are my friends
Call me if you have any problems
Cats can see even in dark places
Comb your hair before you go out
Do not talk with your mouth full
Doing that will take a long time
Father wants to make me a doctor
Figure up how much it amounts to
Go and buy three bottles of coke
Go away before they see you here
God created man in his own image
Have a good look at this picture
He acted like he owned the place
He always cries when he is drunk
He always treats me like a child
He asked me to speak more slowly
He asked me where my uncle lived
He became wiser as he grew older
He believes that he can prove it
He bought a bottle of cheap wine
He called me up almost every day
He came to Japan seven years ago
He can also speak a little Greek
He commanded me to shut the gate
He could not hold back his tears
He cut his finger with the knife
He dared not jump over the brook
He did the work against his will
He found the box under the table
He gave me a lecture on drinking
He gave me his stamp of approval
He goes there three times a week
He had every reason for doing so
He had no memory of the accident
He has a brother and two sisters
He has a large family to support
He has trouble waking up on time
He is a man who loves ceremonies
He is ahead of us in mathematics
He is anxious to know the result
He is beginning to lose his hair
He is expected to come home soon
He is living apart from his wife
He is nothing more than a coward
He is old enough to travel alone
He is pleased with his new shoes
He is still sitting on the bench
He is the chief of my department
He is the father of two children
He is very stingy with his money
He is well liked by his students
He kicked the ball with his foot
He knows every inch of this area
He knows how to behave in public
He knows how to fly a helicopter
He leaves for New York next week
He left Japan never to come back
He likes sports as well as music
He lived in Ankara for six years
He lived to be seventy years old
He lives by himself in the woods
He lost his ticket for the movie
He makes good use of his talents
He may have missed his usual bus
He never takes me out for dinner
He owes his success to good luck
He played the piano and she sang
He proved to be an ideal husband
He read the letter over and over
He sat and listened to the radio
He scraped the mud off his boots
He shook his son by the shoulder
He should be back any minute now
He silently went out of the room
He stared at me and said nothing
He stuck his knife into the tree
He taught a group of Indian boys
He thanked her for her kind help
He thought that I was very tired
He told me good things about you
He told the students to be quiet
He took the wrong bus by mistake
He tried to soothe the angry man
He turned to his friend for help
He used his umbrella as a weapon
He usually went to bed at eleven
He wants a watch just like yours
He wants to get a new dictionary
He was a weak and delicate child
He was elected mayor of the city
He was framed on a murder charge
He was involved in a murder case
He was the last person to arrive
He weighed the stone in his hand
He weighs a lot more than before
He will forever be in our hearts
He will make a good team captain
He wiped the sweat from his brow
He wiped the sweat from his face
He wondered why she did not come
He wrote it down in his notebook
Help yourself to a piece of cake
Her beauty cast a spell over him
Her dream will one day come true
Her red dress made her stand out
Here is the fish my mother baked
Here is the house where he lived
His brother was lost in the town
His guess turned out to be right
His office is very close to mine
His opinion was the same as mine
His story turned out to be false
His wife opened the door for him
His wife seems to be a foreigner
Honesty will pay in the long run
I admit there are a few problems
I advised him to give up smoking
I advised him to keep the secret
I always counted you as a friend
I am eating lunch with my sister
I am expecting a letter from her
I am in favor of the proposition
I am looking for a jewelry store
I am losing my patience with you
I am tired of my monotonous life
I appreciate what you did for me
I beg of you to listen carefully
I believe she is a charming girl
I bought this book the other day
I can hardly wait to get started
I carried the box on my shoulder
I could see Tokyo Tower far away
I could sense that Tom was upset
I did not mean to disappoint her
I do hope you enjoyed the dinner
I do not believe in magic spells
I do not believe that God exists
I do not know anything about him
I eat my breakfast in the office
I fear for the future of mankind
I feel lucky to have been chosen
I feel sick whenever I see blood
I figured that might be the case
I figured you might want a drink
I forgot to give him the message
I gave up smoking six months ago
I get arrested from time to time
I go swimming every chance I get
I go to the country every summer
I got up very early this morning
I had a really nice time tonight
I had a strange dream last night
I had no idea what was happening
I had to do everything by myself
I had to help with the housework
I had to look after the children
I had to see someone on business
I have a craving for fresh fruit
I have a daughter in high school
I have a friend living in London
I have courage and a strong will
I have no place to sleep tonight
I have nothing to say against it
I have some pictures to show you
I have thirteen names on my list
I have to choose between the two
I have to support a large family
I have two brothers and a sister
I have very few books in English
I hear that his father is abroad
I hope all your dreams come true
I hope it does not rain tomorrow
I imagine Tom will be a finalist
I intend to go to the barbershop
I intend to listen to it tonight
I just downloaded a lot of files
I just dropped in to say goodbye
I just got a little carried away
I just got out of a relationship
I just had to check on something
I just have one question for you
I just want to hear your reasons
I just wanted to make that clear
I know a lot about this computer
I know that he keeps his promise
I know what those books are like
I know where you hide your diary
I laughed so hard I almost cried
I learned to cook from my mother
I let my friend copy my homework
I like coffee much more than tea
I like taking walks in the woods
I liked your idea and adopted it
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo
I looked at myself in the mirror
I lost ten kilos in three months
I love the sound of rain falling
I love you more than anyone else
I made a complete fool of myself
I made some mistakes on the test
I make a point of being punctual
I must admit that I was mistaken
I need it as quickly as possible
I need to finish reading my book
I need you to check on something
I never had to worry about money
I never really wanted to do that
I no longer want to visit Boston
I often go fishing in that river
I only have fifty meters of rope
I played with Tom and Mary today
I promised him to keep it secret
I put my family before my career
I read about it in the newspaper
I read this book again and again
I really need to talk to someone
I really think we should do this
I really want to figure this out
I remember the first time we met
I saw your brother the other day
I screwed up the very first note
I share this room with my sister
I speak French every day at work
I speak French with Tom and Mary
I spent my vacation at the beach
I stayed there until he had left
I stepped aside so he could pass
I still have some homework to do
I studied all week for that quiz
I think I left the water running
I think Tom does a fantastic job
I think Tom is smarter than that
I think Tom works in this office
I think Tom would tell the truth
I think that she knows the truth
I think that we should try again
I think the train will come soon
I think this coat should fit you
I think we can finish this later
I think we could be good friends
I think we could help each other
I think we should all go outside
I think you did an excellent job
I think you might need some help
I think you should go to college
I thought I would find you there
I thought we were going to crash
I thought you could use a friend
I thought you might want a drink
I thought you might want to know
I thought you were older than me
I treated her as my own daughter
I want a piece of chocolate cake
I want to ask you some questions
I want to get a sightseeing visa
I want to know why this happened
I want to learn how to snowboard
I want to make a good impression
I want to study abroad next year
I want you to take this medicine
I wanted to speak with you first
I was asked to identify the body
I was born and raised right here
I was called on in English class
I was injured while I was skiing
I was just trying to be friendly
I was just trying to impress him
I was just trying to protect you
I was too afraid to say anything
I was unable to stand any longer
I was very surprised at the news
I was wondering if we could talk
I went home to change my clothes
I went to a shoe store yesterday
I went to the park last Saturday
I went to two concerts last week
I will ask him about it tomorrow
I will do anything to please her
I wish I could remember her name
I wish I could remember his name
I wish he would write more often
I wonder what to make for dinner
I would like to buy some aspirin
I would like to order a sandwich
I would like to see the festival
Invite him over to watch a movie
It all depends how you handle it
It appears that he is a musician
It has been snowing for two days
It is about time we were leaving
It is becoming warmer day by day
It is expensive to live in Japan
It is likely to be fine tomorrow
It just was not my day yesterday
It seems obvious that he is sick
It seems that he knows the truth
It was obvious that he was lying
It was the calm before the storm
It was very dark inside the mine
Just sit back and enjoy the show
Let me ask you a stupid question
Let me explain it with a diagram
Let me show you around our house
Let us know whether you can come
Let us never speak of this again
Liquor is not sold at this store
Living on a small income is hard
Look on both sides of the shield
Mary is now studying in her room
Maybe Tom will help us find Mary
Maybe you should turn off the TV
Money is the last thing he wants
My brother and I shared the room
My brother and I were very close
My brother took me to the museum
My cat is hiding under the stove
My daughter is in her late teens
My father bought this hat for me
My father died before I was born
My father is very strict with me
My father takes a walk every day
My house is north of the library
My joints ache when it gets cold
My little sister is kind of lazy
My mother is in the hospital now
My sister always makes fun of me
My sister is also my best friend
My watch loses ten minutes a day
My watch loses two minutes a day
Never forget to put out the fire
No one I know goes there anymore
No one comes to visit me anymore
No one knows his address but Tom
Nobody but you can make me happy
Nobody told me Tom would be here
Not all of the staff was present
Nothing is as simple as it seems
Nothing was to be seen but water
One of the girls was left behind
People like Tom lie all the time
Please call me at my hotel later
Please help me take this lid off
Please move the desk to the left
Please tell me what you saw then
Put the book on the bottom shelf
She acted as if she knew nothing
She advised him about what to do
She advised him to go by bicycle
She advised him to go home early
She advised him to use a bicycle
She and I are brother and sister
She became a true friend of mine
She began to like him right away
She came to like the new teacher
She can play the piano very well
She cast an eye in his direction
She cried as she read the letter
She did her best to persuade him
She dumped him for a younger man
She gave birth to a healthy baby
She gave me a book for Christmas
She happened to have the day off
She has a little money put aside
She has an eye for the beautiful
She has to look after her mother
She is fond of singing old songs
She is getting better day by day
She is saving money to go abroad
She is two years younger than me
She is very much like her mother
She likes to cook for her family
She lives in quite a big mansion
She looked him right in the eyes
She loved him with all her heart
She picked him up at the station
She promised not to go out alone
She quit her job for some reason
She refused my offer to help her
She refuses to say more about it
She ripped her dress on a branch
She said that she had been happy
She says she will call you later
She thanked him for all his help
She turned away and began to cry
She used to enjoy being with him
She used to play tennis with him
She waited for him for two hours
She waited for you for two hours
She was about to leave the house
She was accused of telling a lie
She was already in love with him
She was very proud of her father
She went down to the fifth floor
She went to Paris to study music
She went to the hospital by taxi
She will have a child next month
Someday you should give it a try
Summer is the season I like best
Swimming in the sea is great fun
Take as many cookies as you want
Take as many peaches as you like
Tell me where to put these books
Telling lies is a very bad habit
Thanks for adding me as a friend
That box is bigger than this one
That day will go down in history
That hotel is very near the lake
That is the house where he lives
That patient may die at any time
That plane will take off at five
That was only a figure of speech
That would be a really good idea
The ball bounced high in the air
The birds were flying in a group
The cat is sleeping on the table
The cat sleeps next to the couch
The cops are keeping tabs on him
The cost of living has gone down
The day we arrived was a holiday
The doctor is taking care of Tom
The dog follows me wherever I go
The dogs howled at the full moon
The door of the office is yellow
The girl was aware of the danger
The hat costs less than the coat
The heat kept me awake all night
The house is built of red bricks
The lady came from a good family
The lake is deepest at this spot
The leaves blew away in the wind
The mail is delivered once a day
The museum is not open on Monday
The museum is open to the public
The new film was a great success
The old lady stepped off the bus
The old man was starved to death
The prince was lost in the woods
The ring was nowhere to be found
The room is being painted by him
The rule holds good in this case
The rumor turned out to be false
The rumor was not based on facts
The sales of this model took off
The sign indicates the way to go
The stars are shining in the sky
The storm caused a lot of damage
The story begins a long time ago
The sun always rises in the east
The water was calm and very blue
The whole family was sick in bed
The word is not in my dictionary
The world is full of dumb people
There are four seasons in a year
There are many fish in this lake
There are many parks in our town
There are no chairs in this room
There are some books on the desk
There are some flies on the wall
There is a television in my room
There is an apple under the desk
There is no chance of rain today
There is no hope of his recovery
There is no reason for this fear
There was a good reason for this
They are looking to you for help
They could not find work at home
They elected her to be the mayor
They have very little to live on
They kept me waiting for an hour
They looked as if they would cry
They moved in just the other day
They stood up for what was right
This day will go down in history
This desk takes up too much room
This does not concern you at all
This hut is a very special place
This ink stain will not wash out
This is an exception to the rule
This is how I solved the problem
This is the letter for my friend
This is the very book you wanted
This knife was very useful to me
This milk will keep for two days
This offer is good for five days
This shop is a rental video shop
This textbook is too hard for me
This train is bound for New York
This tree is older than that car
Those men are armed to the teeth
Tom and I have nothing in common
Tom and Mary are looking for you
Tom and Mary are older than John
Tom and Mary are the same height
Tom asked Mary where the dog was
Tom asked me what the matter was
Tom borrowed a car from a friend
Tom came out of his hiding place
Tom could have told me the truth
Tom died before his son was born
Tom died in prison ten years ago
Tom eats the same food every day
Tom forgot the keys on the table
Tom gets up at six every morning
Tom has been watching TV all day
Tom has begun writing a new book
Tom has changed a lot since then
Tom has made up his mind already
Tom has never asked me for money
Tom has sold his house in Boston
Tom is refusing to pay his bills
Tom is the fattest person I know
Tom is the tallest in his family
Tom is three years older than me
Tom is too young to travel alone
Tom knew he needed to leave town
Tom knew that Mary was a teacher
Tom knew that Mary was in Boston
Tom knew that Mary was in danger
Tom knew what Mary wanted to eat
Tom knows the man Mary came with
Tom left the lights on all night
Tom made good money on that deal
Tom never told me he was married
Tom offered Mary a slice of cake
Tom opened his eyes and saw Mary
Tom poured Mary a glass of water
Tom prefers not to talk about it
Tom seems to be an honest person
Tom sees this in a different way
Tom shot at Mary with a crossbow
Tom takes good care of the birds
Tom took the ring off his finger
Tom waited for more than an hour
Tom was afraid to cross the road
Tom was expecting you to say yes
Tom was lying in bed watching TV
Tom was surprised by what he saw
Tom was the only one who laughed
Tom went to the circus with Mary
Tom went to the museum with Mary
Tom will be delighted to see you
Tomorrow is my first day of work
Very few fat men have long noses
We all breathed a sigh of relief
We always have to obey the rules
We arrived at the office on time
We came back to camp before dark
We got behind the car and pushed
We had a good time playing chess
We have the whole summer to play
We helped them out when we could
We just want Tom to keep working
We like doing things our own way
We listened to her for some time
We must cancel our trip to Japan
We must not speak in the library
We must take care of the elderly
We need to burn all these leaves
We need to clarify a few details
We need to prepare for the worst
We saw a funny movie last Sunday
We saw the tower in the distance
We solved that problem in a week
We talked about what we could do
We talked over the plan with him
We took turns in washing the car
We used to talk about our future
We watched the soccer game on TV
We were all present at the party
We were destined to meet one day
We were not invited to the party
What you decided to do is insane
Women today drink as much as men
You are watching TV all the time
You can call me anytime you like
You can say whatever you want to
You had better go to the dentist
You had better put on a raincoat
You have good reason to be angry
You have the same camera as mine
You have to choose your own path
You hit the center of the target
You look a lot like your brother
You may choose any book you like
You must always do what is right
You must be very busy these days
You must get up a little earlier
You really have an ear for music
You remember it better than I do
You should make up your own mind
You will know the truth some day
Your idea sounds like a good one
Your secret will be safe with me
A DNA test showed he was innocent
A ball is floating down the river
A crazy thing just happened to me
A fire broke out during the night
A laptop is better than a desktop
A mustache grows on the upper lip
A sleeping child is like an angel
A smell of lilies filled the room
Air is a mixture of several gases
Air is a mixture of various gases
All of my children live in Boston
All sorts of people live in Tokyo
All the boys in class worked hard
All the other boys laughed at him
Central Park is near where I work
Christmas is only a few days away
Clocks used to be wound every day
Come and see me whenever you like
Dad extended his legs on the sofa
Death is an integral part of life
Eat your soup before it gets cold
Empty the water out of the bucket
Every door in the house is locked
Everyone seemed sad to see Tom go
France is to the south of England
Give him the benefit of the doubt
Gold is similar in color to brass
He affirmed that he saw the crash
He agreed to give us an interview
He always comes here at this time
He asked her where her mother was
He backed his car into the garage
He blames his failure on bad luck
He bored us with his long stories
He cut some branches off the tree
He decided not to wait any longer
He demanded that we leave at once
He did not speak unless spoken to
He discovered how to open the box
He drank very little of the water
He earns three times more than me
He forgot his promise to go there
He gave me a smile of recognition
He gave me authority to fire them
He gave the same answer as before
He got hurt in the game yesterday
He got more than he bargained for
He had friends all over the world
He has done better than last time
He has had a long teaching career
He has never been late for school
He has this large room to himself
He imitated the works of Van Gogh
He is able to speak ten languages
He is busy preparing for the trip
He is by nature a generous person
He is known to the entire country
He is married to an American lady
He is nothing more than a dreamer
He is old enough to understand it
He is quick to voice his concerns
He is studying in the library now
He is the stingiest person I know
He is very good at playing violin
He is well spoken of by everybody
He knows a lot about wild animals
He likes taking a walk by himself
He lives in the suburbs of London
He lost his balance and fell down
He lost his sight in the accident
He made his way through the crowd
He made sure nobody could see her
He made sure nobody could see him
He may be jogging around the park
He measured the length of the bed
He missed the train by one minute
He mistook me for my twin brother
He must have gotten over his cold
He often reads far into the night
He paid no attention to my advice
He plays the piano better than me
He pretended not to hear his boss
He pretended that he was a lawyer
He read a book written in English
He rested his hand on my shoulder
He runs a supermarket in the town
He said good night to his parents
He said that he wanted some money
He seems to have left the country
He seems to have missed the point
He set out for Tokyo this morning
He stood with his feet wide apart
He swore never to trust her again
He talks as if he knew everything
He thought maybe this was a trick
He threw the letter into the fire
He timed her in the marathon race
He took a book from the bookshelf
He turned to his friends for help
He wants to live closer to nature
He wants to study music and dance
He was caught with his pants down
He was exhausted when he got home
He was in good health last summer
He was satisfied with his new car
He was scared you would shoot him
He was sitting and reading a book
He was willing to work for others
He will advise you on that matter
He will do anything to make money
His ideas never earned him a dime
His leg was bitten by a crocodile
His office is on the eighth floor
His remark was really out of line
His wealth has not made him happy
How thoughtless of you to do that
I almost forgot to do my homework
I am determined to be a scientist
I am glad that you have succeeded
I avoid going there late at night
I believe it is a genuine Picasso
I bought the book for ten dollars
I broke the lock opening the door
I brought some samples of my work
I can solve the problem by myself
I convinced him that he was wrong
I could have sworn I saw somebody
I could recite the story by heart
I could scarcely stand on my feet
I could see that Tom was grinning
I dipped my finger into the honey
I disagree with you on the matter
I exchanged a camera for a guitar
I expect to sing better next time
I fail to understand his true aim
I feel inclined to agree with her
I figured Tom would never find it
I figured you could use some help
I forgot my shopping list at home
I found the earring that you lost
I found this watch at the station
I got a telescope for my birthday
I got five hours sleep last night
I guess it depends on the weather
I guess this still belongs to you
I had a dreadful dream last night
I had a horrible dream last night
I had a little fever this morning
I had a pleasant dream last night
I had a really great time tonight
I had a terrible dream last night
I had expected him at the meeting
I hardly got any sleep last night
I have a little something for you
I have an urgent message from Tom
I have just come back from school
I have just washed all the dishes
I have never seen anyone like him
I have never seen anyone like you
I have nothing in common with her
I have some idea of what happened
I have the minutes of the meeting
I have three chickens in my house
I have two daughters and two sons
I have two sons and two daughters
I heard Tom is filing for divorce
I heard him humming in the shower
I heard it from a reliable source
I heard someone knock on the door
I helped you when you needed help
I hope your wishes will come true
I insist on being paid in advance
I intend on fighting till the end
I intended to have been a teacher
I introduced her to you last week
I just have a couple of questions
I just need to know what happened
I just want to check on something
I just want to tell Tom something
I just want tonight to be special
I killed two birds with one stone
I know my keys are here somewhere
I know several good places to eat
I left Tom a message this morning
I left my jacket in the classroom
I like red wine better than white
I like the way this flower smells
I listened to some CDs last night
I live in a small fishing village
I lived in Sasayama two years ago
I love listening to you guys sing
I managed to catch the last train
I met some hikers on the mountain
I missed the bus by three minutes
I must remind you of your promise
I never thought about it that way
I never want to get married again
I never wanted all this to happen
I object to her going there alone
I objected to his paying the bill
I often catch colds in the winter
I only found out about that today
I persuaded him that he was wrong
I planned to introduce him to her
I prefer being poor to being rich
I presented him with a gold watch
I presented my ticket at the door
I put your suitcases in your room
I ran away from the training camp
I read about him in the newspaper
I read the letter again and again
I really have nothing else to say
I really should be getting to bed
I really wish I could believe you
I refuse to be ignored any longer
I regret having done such a thing
I remember that I closed the door
I remember the warmth of his arms
I sat down and opened my notebook
I saw Tom and Mary leave together
I saw a horse galloping toward me
I saw a stranger enter that house
I saw my reflection in the window
I say this from my own experience
I sharpened a pencil with a knife
I should have done this weeks ago
I should have done this years ago
I spent twelve hours on the train
I spilled my coffee on the carpet
I stayed home because of the rain
I still need to renew my passport
I strongly advise you to use this
I suppose I felt a little jealous
I suppose we have nothing to lose
I think Tom wants to kill himself
I think Tom will be well prepared
I think my Japanese is really bad
I think perhaps Tom can help Mary
I think we can work something out
I think we could be great friends
I think we should all go together
I think we should be getting back
I think we should call the police
I think we should just be friends
I think we should stop doing that
I think you made the right choice
I think you must be getting tired
I think you owe me an explanation
I think you should do it yourself
I thought Tom would want the work
I thought it would make you laugh
I thought the food was too greasy
I thought you had all the answers
I took on the job of proofreading
I took part in the sporting event
I took the liberty of calling her
I totally agree with what you say
I tried writing with my left hand
I usually got to bed about eleven
I want to be treated with respect
I want to eat meat and vegetables
I want to set the record straight
I want to travel around the world
I want your name and badge number
I wanted to see what would happen
I was able to answer the question
I was already married at your age
I was obliged to go out yesterday
I was stupid enough to believe it
I was surprised by what I learned
I was taken aback by his rudeness
I was ten minutes late for school
I was the first to begin speaking
I was trapped in a vicious circle
I was walking to the station then
I went to sleep during the lesson
I will finish my homework by nine
I will follow you wherever you go
I will give him the book tomorrow
I will give you anything you want
I will give you whatever you want
I will have him repair this watch
I will have it uploaded by Friday
I will leave it to your judgement
I wish I had eaten something else
I wish it would happen more often
I wish my father had lived longer
I wonder if it will rain tomorrow
I wonder if the weather will hold
I wonder what has happened to her
I wonder who this package is from
I wonder why the dogs are barking
I would like to visit South Korea
I would rather die than marry him
I would rather not go there alone
It feels very similar to this one
It has no bearing on this problem
It is easy to answer the question
It is premature to discuss it now
It is probable that she will come
It looks like your dog is thirsty
It makes no difference who I meet
It was crowded here all last week
It was obvious that they had lied
It was supposed to be kept secret
It was very nice seeing you again
Keep the child away from the pond
Language can be used in many ways
Let me get you something to drink
Let me help you with your baggage
Let me tell you about our special
Let me tell you everything I know
Life is boring in a small village
Listening to music is lots of fun
Mary is going to help us tomorrow
Men are better at this than women
Men talk about women all the time
Monkeys can learn a lot of tricks
Most were unable to read or write
My belief is that he will succeed
My boss is keeping me pretty busy
My camera is much better than his
My cat is suffering from the heat
My doctor told me to quit smoking
My father does not eat much fruit
My hens laid fewer eggs last year
My job is giving me a stomachache
My mother allowed me to go abroad
My mother knows how to make cakes
My mother looks young for her age
My name was omitted from the list
My older sister is good at typing
My son is ashamed of his behavior
My uncle lives next to the school
My watch gains five seconds a day
My watch loses five minutes a day
No one informed me of his failure
No one wanted to insult these men
Nobody knows why he left the town
Not all of those books are useful
Nowadays jobs are hard to come by
One of the boys suddenly ran away
Onions can be eaten raw or cooked
People of all ages like this song
Please drop me off at the station
Please keep my place in this line
Please sit on this chair and wait
Please take me to the Grand Hotel
Please wake me up at six tomorrow
Renting a car was the best option
She advised him to go there alone
She advised him to take the money
She always expects me to help her
She backed out at the last moment
She bought this pen at that store
She declined to say more about it
She drinks a little wine at times
She gave me access to her records
She gets hives when she eats eggs
She got him to eat his vegetables
She has been sick since last week
She hates fish and never eats any
She hung the calendar on the wall
She insisted that it was my fault
She is around twenty years of age
She is as beautiful as Snow White
She is as beautiful as her mother
She is ashamed of her old clothes
She is five years younger than me
She is on friendly terms with him
She is related to him by marriage
She is unable to cope with stress
She is very proud of her daughter
She left the hospital an hour ago
She likes being looked at by boys
She made an excuse for being late
She made her husband an apple pie
She must still be in her twenties
She played the guitar and he sang
She pleaded with him to not leave
She pressured him to quit his job
She put up the new curtains today
She should have bought a used car
She showed me which dress to wear
She spoke to him about the matter
She thinks about him all the time
She thought that I was the doctor
She told him that she was leaving
She wanted him to help her father
She was afraid of waking the baby
She was laughed at by her friends
She went to the movies by herself
She works as hard as anybody does
She would often play tricks on me
Shoes are stiff when they are new
Some of them did very little work
Some people have a terror of mice
Space travel is no longer a dream
Spare the rod and spoil the child
Steam is coming out of the engine
Stop hiding your head in the sand
Take a deep breath and then relax
Take your hand out of your pocket
Take your time when you eat meals
Tell him to mind his own business
Tell me how the robbery went down
Ten is ten percent of one hundred
Thank you very much for your help
That bicycle is too small for you
That girl over there is my sister
That hotel was very near the lake
That is the office where he works
That pair of pliers came in handy
That reporter has a nose for news
The answer to your question is no
The arrow indicates the way to go
The baby seemed to be fast asleep
The bags were piled up behind him
The bus stop is across the street
The cat is hiding under the couch
The chickens were killed by a fox
The child picked up a small stone
The city wants to extend the road
The crowd cried out for an encore
The days are longer in the summer
The desk seems small in this room
The driver of the bus was injured
The family had its dinner at noon
The gunman was found to be insane
The heater is warming up the room
The ice gave way under his weight
The issue is quite familiar to us
The lake is deepest at this point
The little girl hid in the closet
The mailman left a letter for her
The man was given a life sentence
The meeting is held twice a month
The new boy had a nervous stammer
The noise kept me awake all night
The old woman was nearly run over
The origin of the fire is unknown
The parking lot is free of charge
The prince became a king that day
The problem is as good as settled
The puppy licked her on the cheek
The report turned out to be false
The road is in a deplorable state
The roof was damaged by the storm
The ship ran aground on a sandbar
The source of the fire is unknown
The sun is brighter than the moon
The theory is too abstract for me
The thief got away with the money
The thief was bound hand and foot
The tree fell over in the typhoon
The very idea of it is disgusting
The weather is cold all year here
The wind is blowing from the east
The wind is blowing from the west
There are many people in the park
There are some apples in that box
There are ten people in this room
There are too many ads on YouTube
There is a cookie under the table
There is a fence around the house
There is a television in the room
There is an urgent need for money
There is an urgent need for water
There is no limit to the universe
There is no use in making excuses
There is often fog in the morning
There was no one there besides me
There were some boats on the lake
They accused him of telling a lie
They did away with the old system
They drive on the left in England
They forced him to tell the truth
They laugh at him behind his back
They make good use of their rooms
They must have known it all along
They relaxed in front of the fire
They say that he is seriously ill
They say that he knows the secret
They spent the night on the beach
They want to tell you their story
This TV show is aimed at children
This applies to your case as well
This beef is very nice and tender
This desk is better than that one
This dress would look good on you
This is a beautiful piece of meat
This is a hard question to answer
This is the calm before the storm
This park is famous for its roses
This shot will help numb the pain
To make money one must want money
Tom always treats me like a child
Tom and Mary are looking for John
Tom and Mary got into an argument
Tom and Mary know each other well
Tom and Mary want to learn French
Tom asked Mary to call the police
Tom asked Mary to read the letter
Tom asked Mary to sweep the floor
Tom asked Mary why she was crying
Tom asked me whether I was hungry
Tom asked the stranger who he was
Tom backed out at the last moment
Tom began to feel a little guilty
Tom bought a nice house in Boston
Tom caught a whole string of fish
Tom caused quite a lot of trouble
Tom did his best to persuade Mary
Tom gave Mary a box of chocolates
Tom goes there three times a week
Tom had one of his legs amputated
Tom handed Mary a bottle of water
Tom has decided to major in music
Tom has lots of friends in Boston
Tom is now taller than his father
Tom is the best drummer in Boston
Tom is the person I saw yesterday
Tom is the person who helped Mary
Tom is three years older than you
Tom is unable to cope with stress
Tom is usually at home on Sundays
Tom just got back to Boston today
Tom kept Mary waiting for an hour
Tom looks older than he really is
Tom loved Mary and Mary loved him
Tom put the envelope on the table
Tom saw Mary walking up the steps
Tom seems really happy to be here
Tom struggled to climb to the top
Tom told me you needed some money
Tom tried to cover up his mistake
Tom usually goes to school by bus
Tom wanted to be a better teacher
Tom wanted to say goodbye to Mary
Tom was one of the invited guests
Tom was sitting alone in his room
Tom was sitting at a nearby table
Tom was stabbed twice in the back
Tom went to sleep three hours ago
Tom will drive you to the airport
Tom wiped his feet on the doormat
Tom works at a hospital near here
Try not to be late again tomorrow
We all live in the same dormitory
We always take it easy on Sundays
We are in part responsible for it
We are supposed to know the rules
We had a heavy frost this morning
We hang out together all the time
We have two daughters and one son
We left home early in the morning
We left the final decision to him
We must try to break the deadlock
We need to finish what we started
We need to focus on our strengths
We need to take this into account
We noticed the man enter her room
We saw her when leaving the house
We shared the profit among us all
We should have told him the truth
We still have plenty of time left
We want to reach a wider audience
We were deeply moved by her story
We were late because of the storm
We will have to postpone the game
We will take part in the marathon
Women are better at this than men
You almost gave me a heart attack
You are expecting too much of her
You are too young to travel alone
You expect too much of your child
You have a strange sense of humor
You have no obligation to help us
You have only to push this button
You have only to touch the button
You know very well what Tom wants
You might as well just enjoy life
You might want to grab some sleep
You might want to try it sometime
You must steer clear of that gang
You really lucked out on this one
You said the same thing about Tom
You seem to have the wrong number
You should face up to the reality
You should get rid of these weeds
You will be able to speak English
Your friendship means a lot to me
A bill came along with the package
A car was coming in this direction
A cat appeared from under the desk
A curtain of mist blocked our view
A fire broke out during that night
A great future is reserved for him
A group of young men were fighting
A heavy tax was imposed on whiskey
A lot of soldiers were killed here
A man is responsible for his deeds
A mouse is running around the room
A passing car splashed water on us
A really bad thing happened to him
A screen divided the room into two
A storm confined them to the house
A true friend would not betray you
Aim the video camera at that group
All at once there was an explosion
All my friends and family are dead
All of them agreed to the proposal
All the money was spent on clothes
All the old magazines are sold out
An accident may happen at any time
An actor has to memorize his lines
An elephant is a very large animal
An image is worth a thousand words
Ask him when the next plane leaves
Bad weather kept us from going out
Being with you makes me feel happy
Both of my sisters are not married
Bring it back when you are through
Choose the color you like the best
Cricket is a game that takes skill
Either you or your friend is wrong
Even a loser can dress for success
Final exams are two weeks from now
Food is still scarce in the region
Gasoline is no longer a cheap fuel
Give the book to whomever wants it
He adapted himself to his new life
He arrived at the station at seven
He asked me if I liked mathematics
He broke up the chair for firewood
He can speak just a little English
He caught a boy stealing his watch
He claims to have visions from God
He denied having said such a thing
He died without having made a will
He erased his speech from the tape
He follows the rules to the letter
He found a nice apartment for Mary
He gathered up his things and left
He grasped the rope with two hands
He has been sick since last Sunday
He has been studying for two hours
He has been waiting here some time
He helped poor people all his life
He hid himself behind a large rock
He instantly fell in love with her
He is a reporter for Time magazine
He is able to speak five languages
He is always looking to the future
He is captain of the football team
He is content with the simple life
He is engaged to my younger sister
He is immediately above me in rank
He is less strict than our teacher
He is not very good at mathematics
He is the father of three children
He is wandering around in a trance
He likes taking care of the garden
He likes that video game very much
He looked at me for an explanation
He lured her away from her husband
He made a mistake and drank poison
He must have taken the wrong train
He passed the test as was expected
He pointed to the tower over there
He ran faster than his brother did
He runs the business with his sons
He sat there with his legs crossed
He searched all day for the letter
He seems to have finished his work
He should have kept his mouth shut
He sneaked around to the back door
He sounded very tired on the phone
He speaks English better than I do
He stuck his pencil behind his ear
He talks as if he knows everything
He tends to get upset over nothing
He took the wrong train by mistake
He wants to reach a wider audience
He was absent because of the storm
He was always faithful to his wife
He was covered all over with paint
He was looking for this very thing
He was silly enough to believe her
He was very good at playing tennis
He went away without saying a word
He will get nowhere with his plans
He will live forever in our hearts
He will never visit the town again
Her sister is not going to America
Her voice is pleasant to listen to
His family did not have much money
His parents expect too much of him
His sister is not going to America
His voice is pleasant to listen to
His youngest son is five years old
Hokkaido is to the north of Honshu
I advised him to keep that promise
I almost never listen to the radio
I always catch colds in the winter
I always drive at a moderate speed
I am a student at Hyogo University
I am accustomed to staying up late
I am convinced that he is innocent
I am determined to give up smoking
I am doubtful whether he will come
I am going to play soccer tomorrow
I am looking forward to seeing you
I am married and have two children
I am staying for another few weeks
I am thinking of resigning at once
I am yawning because I feel sleepy
I ate nothing but bread and butter
I bought a new computer last month
I bought that record in this store
I bought two tickets for a concert
I can seldom find time for reading
I could sure use that reward money
I enjoy the time we spend together
I exercise for two hours every day
I feel like getting some fresh air
I feel like someone is watching me
I feel like someone is watching us
I fell asleep while reading a book
I figured this might come in handy
I figured you might need some help
I forced him to carry the suitcase
I forgot how beautiful it was here
I found it difficult to please her
I found the key underneath the mat
I found your letter in the mailbox
I get along well with my neighbors
I get scared just walking past him
I had a long conversation with Tom
I had a really good time yesterday
I had already heard that song once
I had my bicycle stolen last night
I had my secretary type the letter
I had no idea you collected stamps
I had nothing in particular to say
I had some help painting the fence
I have complete faith in my doctor
I have lived here for thirty years
I have more dresses than my sister
I have never seen anything like it
I have not heard from her recently
I have one brother and two sisters
I have to solve the problem myself
I have two brothers and one sister
I have two sisters and one brother
I have urgent matters to attend to
I heard it thunder in the distance
I heard someone come into the room
I hope that your brother is better
I intend to study abroad next year
I just banged my head on something
I just really need some time alone
I left my umbrella here last night
I like vanilla ice cream very much
I like writing with a fountain pen
I listen to the radio after dinner
I look forward to hearing from you
I look forward to our next meeting
I look forward to seeing you again
I never dreamed of seeing you here
I never saw anyone like Tom before
I never thought Tom would hit Mary
I never wanted to compete with you
I opened the box and looked inside
I really need to talk with someone
I refreshed myself with a hot bath
I refuse to listen to your excuses
I refuse to reply to these charges
I returned the book to the library
I revealed the truth of the matter
I saw something strange in the sky
I should think she is under thirty
I stopped smoking once and for all
I studied English when I was there
I suggest trying to get some sleep
I suggest we swim across the river
I think Tom and Mary are Canadians
I think Tom wants something to eat
I think you deserve more than this
I think you owe her an explanation
I think you should leave Tom alone
I think you should talk to someone
I thought doing this would be easy
I thought it best to remain silent
I thought you might need some help
I thought you might want this back
I thought you said you worked here
I tried to listen to him carefully
I want everything to be just right
I want permission to go home early
I want to know everything about it
I want to know everything you know
I want to leave this place quickly
I want to lodge a formal complaint
I want to take another look around
I want you to promise me something
I want you to remember this moment
I wanted to buy you something nice
I wanted to know what would happen
I wanted to retire three years ago
I was beginning to worry about you
I was foolish enough to believe it
I was involved in a petty argument
I was late for school this morning
I was reading a book while walking
I was stupid enough to believe Tom
I was tired from doing my homework
I will call back in twenty minutes
I will give you the money tomorrow
I will introduce you to my parents
I will start working on July first
I wish I could be more spontaneous
I wish I could have spoken Spanish
I wish that she would stop smoking
I wonder which one I should choose
I wonder which way is the shortest
I wonder why karaoke is so popular
I would like a chocolate ice cream
I would like to tell you something
It happened when Tom was in Boston
It is difficult to give up smoking
It is going to rain this afternoon
It is starting to look pretty cool
It is worthwhile to read this book
It scared the daylights out of him
It seems my dreams never come true
It was a case of mistaken identity
It was a miracle that he recovered
It was his bicycle that was stolen
It was nothing less than a miracle
Just give me your name and address
Let me introduce my parents to you
Life is like a roller coaster ride
Life is often compared to a voyage
Long skirts are out of fashion now
Look up the word in the dictionary
Love began to grow between the two
Magda is going to marry a Spaniard
Mahjong is a game four people play
Many of the workers died of hunger
Maybe we can talk about that later
My aunt sent me a birthday present
My baby brother still wets his bed
My bike is not anything like yours
My daughter was taken away from me
My dog often pretends to be asleep
My father lives and works in Tokyo
My grandfather died when I was boy
My husband is away for the weekend
My meals are prepared by my mother
My mother set the table for dinner
My sister got married in her teens
My sister is a very beautiful girl
My sister is afraid of all doctors
My sister is older than my brother
My sister is very fond of children
My sister made me a beautiful doll
My success was largely due to luck
My watch loses three minutes a day
Neither of us wants to get married
Never bite the hand that feeds you
No one was punished for the fiasco
Nobody but a fool would believe it
Nobody has the right to control us
None of his advice was very useful
Nothing seems to grow in this soil
Nothing will take me away from you
One of my pleasures is watching TV
One stayed and the other went away
Our dog buries bones in the garden
Our success was due to his efforts
People like him because he is kind
Plants take in water from the soil
Please bring us two cups of coffee
Please deposit the money in a bank
Please give me a dozen cream puffs
Please pass me the salt and pepper
Please speak as clearly as you can
Please take a look at that picture
Please take a look at this picture
Please tell me the story once more
She accused me of making a mistake
She advised him to be more careful
She advised him to drink more milk
She advised him to give up smoking
She advised him to read more books
She advised him to see the dentist
She applied a bandage to the wound
She baked her husband an apple pie
She blamed her failure on bad luck
She choked him with her bare hands
She cried when she heard the story
She extended her stay by five days
She gave me a smile of recognition
She glanced shyly at the young man
She has a large bedroom to herself
She has a natural talent for music
She has nothing in common with him
She has the large house to herself
She is able to speak ten languages
She is afraid of falling ill again
She is always trying to please him
She is busy preparing for the trip
She is very popular among the boys
She laid the magazine on the table
She left her umbrella in the train
She likes to go walking by herself
She lives in this house by herself
She lost what little money she had
She mixed him up with someone else
She put down her thoughts on paper
She put me in a delicate situation
She seems to understand what I say
She stayed there for a short while
She testified that she saw the man
She tied up the parcel with string
She told him to rewrite his resume
She was burning to tell the secret
She was fortunate to pass the exam
She was pleased to see the results
She was pleased with the new dress
She was quite eager in her studies
She was unwilling to tell her name
She was very surprised at the news
She went out without saying a word
She will accompany me on the piano
She will have to cook for everyone
She won the one hundred meter race
Shepherd tried to run and was shot
Some people seem to agree with you
Somehow or other I found his house
Someone said Tom is looking for us
Students should try not to be late
Take the first street to the right
Take the oranges out of the fridge
Tell Tom I still have his umbrella
Tell me how you solved the problem
Thank you in advance for your help
That nurse is very kind and polite
That river is dangerous to swim in
That rock band gives me a headache
That toy is selling like hot cakes
The Bible has it written like this
The Japanese live on rice and fish
The North won the Battle of Shiloh
The air was full of flying bullets
The army has advanced to the river
The baby fell asleep in the cradle
The baby is sleeping in the cradle
The bill passed at the last moment
The book was better than the movie
The boss just chewed him out again
The boy came running into the room
The boy lay listening to the radio
The bridge was built by the Romans
The children got lost in the woods
The clean towels are in the drawer
The country was gearing up for war
The decision has not yet been made
The dictionary on the desk is mine
The driver felt like taking a rest
The elevator is out of order today
The enemy launched an attack on us
The flood deposited a layer of mud
The hill was all covered with snow
The house has been empty for years
The kids are making too much noise
The king once lived in that palace
The library is on the second floor
The next holiday falls on a Sunday
The nurse has given Tom a sedative
The plane crash was only last week
The police will be here any minute
The postman was bitten by that dog
The rain shows no sign of stopping
The report on the meeting is ready
The result is neither good nor bad
The rumor spread all over the town
The saying is quite familiar to us
The smell of roses filled the room
The soldier was wounded in the leg
The sushi at this shop tastes good
The tape recorder was on the table
The teacher allowed him to go home
The tickets sold out within a week
The two sides hold talks this week
The wind is blowing from the north
There are five fish in my aquarium
There is a military base near here
There is a path through the fields
There is a television in this room
There is an error in this sentence
There is an urgent message for you
There is more water than is needed
There is nothing new under the sun
There must be some kind of problem
There were no radios in those days
There will be a math test tomorrow
These pills come in a blister pack
These shirts are all the same size
They all thought that Tom was crazy
They are proud of their clever son
They arrived in England a week ago
They brush their teeth twice a day
They never pay any attention to me
They say that he will never return
They say that old house is haunted
They sell that at a hardware store
They stood talking for a long time
They want me to organize the party
Things are only going to get worse
This book contains a lot of photos
This car is very economical on gas
This clock gains two minutes a day
This dictionary is by far the best
This is a support group for widows
This is the best restaurant I know
This is the tallest tower in Japan
This lake is deepest at this point
This lesson should be kept in mind
This river is the widest in Europe
This song is very popular in Japan
This suitcase is too heavy for you
This ticket is good for three days
This watch is better than that one
This word is also French in origin
Today is the hottest day this year
Tom always shouts when he is angry
Tom and Mary are young and healthy
Tom and Mary both started to laugh
Tom asked Mary to brew some coffee
Tom asked Mary why she was smiling
Tom asked how much the ticket cost
Tom asked me to come back tomorrow
Tom bought a gift for his daughter
Tom built an igloo in his backyard
Tom closed the door of his bedroom
Tom could see that Mary was crying
Tom finished the job in three days
Tom forgot his umbrella in his car
Tom had never seen Mary that angry
Tom has decided to propose to Mary
Tom has friends all over the world
Tom has no intention of doing that
Tom is busy preparing for his trip
Tom is ill at ease among strangers
Tom is in his room studying French
Tom is probably not busy right now
Tom is taking good care of himself
Tom is working as a security guard
Tom left his sunglasses in his car
Tom lives in the middle of nowhere
Tom made his way through the crowd
Tom offered to pay for the damages
Tom poured himself a cup of coffee
Tom poured some cereal into a bowl
Tom pushed the raft into the water
Tom really wants to be your friend
Tom seems to know all that already
Tom seems to want to say something
Tom shares a room with his brother
Tom spilled some wine on his shirt
Tom spoke to the doctors in French
Tom started to take off his jacket
Tom took out a bag of marshmallows
Tom tossed another log on the fire
Tom wanted Mary to accept his gift
Tom wants Mary to keep him company
Tom was offended by what Mary said
Tom was sitting on the couch alone
Tom was the first person to arrive
Tom wondered why his wife left him
We always have to follow the rules
We are traveling on a tight budget
We believe in the existence of God
We elected her captain of our team
We had a heavy rainfall last night
We had no alternative but to fight
We happened to be in Hokkaido then
We happened to meet at the station
We happened to ride the same train
We happened to take the same train
We have decided to adopt your idea
We have known each other for years
We have less than three hours left
We have no options but to continue
We have no secrets from each other
We have walked all around the lake
We learned that he had an accident
We loaded our baggage into the car
We must have something to live for
We need a firm quotation by Monday
We often went skiing in the winter
We only see each other on weekends
We reached the top of the mountain
We saw the children enter the room
We were all present at her wedding
We were all present at the meeting
We were attacked by swarms of bees
We were greeted by a cute waitress
We were surprised to hear the news
We were unable to follow his logic
We will know the truth before long
We would like to stay here tonight
Women were given the right to vote
Work harder if you plan to succeed
Write down your date of birth here
Write it down before you forget it
You and I have something in common
You are entitled to try once again
You are in part responsible for it
You are more stupid than I thought
You are not supposed to smoke here
You can have this book for nothing
You can invite any person you like
You can rely on his proven ability
You deserve so much more than this
You have put your hat on backwards
You know very well how it happened
You look nice with your hair short
You might as well go kill yourself
You might not want to mention that
You must take his age into account
You never told me you were married
You probably just want to be alone
You should be careful what you say
You should have told him the truth
You should not talk back like that
You were such a big help yesterday
You will be missed by your friends
A ceasefire began a few hours later
A friend of mine is studying abroad
A gunshot was heard in the distance
A hundred years is called a century
A man appeared from behind the door
A mighty cheer burst from the crowd
A new topic came up in conversation
A picture is worth a thousand words
A team of paramedics is standing by
A woman appeared from behind a tree
All of us looked through the window
Almost all of my neighbors are nice
An expensive car is a status symbol
Any amount of money will be welcome
Black smoke came out of the chimney
Both Tom and Mary were absent today
Both his father and mother are dead
Both of my parents have passed away
Brown is not her natural hair color
CDs have taken the place of records
Correct the errors if there are any
Cover the seeds with a little earth
Cows are eating grass in the meadow
Eating between meals is a bad habit
Eating fish is good for your health
Every man has his own strong points
Every town in America has a library
Everybody came to the class on time
Everyone needs a place to call home
Few students know how to read Latin
Go upstairs and bring down my trunk
He always mistakes me for my sister
He apologized to her for being late
He appears to be strong and healthy
He beat the odds and was successful
He became famous all over the world
He borrowed the car from his friend
He complained to her about the food
He decided to put off his departure
He died fighting in the Vietnam War
He earned as much money as possible
He exchanged his cow for two horses
He fetched some water from the well
He finds fault with everything I do
He had few friends and little money
He has a perfect command of English
He has a tendency to be pessimistic
He has been busy since this morning
He has four children to provide for
He is always willing to help others
He is less patient than his brother
He is out of circulation these days
He is suffering from loss of memory
He judged it wiser to remain silent
He kept waiting for hours and hours
He landed himself a really plum job
He lives six houses beyond my house
He lost his eyesight in an accident
He made many excuses for being late
He made the most of his opportunity
He managed to swim across the river
He married his daughter to a lawyer
He might have missed the last train
He must have left the water running
He must have missed his usual train
He often gets angry at small things
He pressed his ear against the wall
He ran his fingers through her hair
He remained a bachelor all his life
He speaks French as well as English
He spent the evening reading a book
He spent the morning reading a book
He spoke with a typical Texan drawl
He still has not written the letter
He stood there with his eyes closed
He suggested a plan similar to mine
He threw everything out of the boat
He tried wooing her with love poems
He tucked the napkin under his chin
He was foolish enough to believe it
He was not allowed to remain silent
He was raised in an artistic family
He was sitting with his arms folded
He was stupid enough to believe her
He was surprised by what he learned
He was very pleased with the result
He went there instead of his father
He will object to your going abroad
He wrenched the letter from my hand
Her wish is to study abroad someday
Here is a present for your birthday
His body was covered with brown fur
His face showed that he was annoyed
His failure is due to his ignorance
His failure taught me a good lesson
His skill qualifies him for the job
I always read the sports page first
I am a student at Oxford University
I am accustoming to this life style
I am glad to accept your invitation
I am interested in chess these days
I am intrigued by what is happening
I am looking forward to your letter
I am not concerned with this affair
I am still attached to this bicycle
I apologize if I hurt your feelings
I arrived at Osaka Station at night
I assume your mission was a success
I ate bread and butter this morning
I belong to the rugby football club
I bought a pen like yours yesterday
I bought this racket two months ago
I can carry those suitcases for you
I can neither confirm nor deny this
I can take care of that immediately
I can understand what she is saying
I can understand your point of view
I caught the man stealing the money
I cried myself to sleep every night
I do not like mathematics very much
I feel bad about ruining your party
I felt like I really belonged there
I figured that would make you laugh
I finally caught up with my friends
I find it difficult to believe that
I found your slippers under the bed
I got acquainted with her in France
I got acquainted with him last year
I had already spotted him from afar
I had hoped we might become friends
I had no control over the situation
I had the gardener plant some trees
I have a good appetite this morning
I have a large collection of stamps
I have a previous engagement at ten
I have four sisters and one brother
I have nothing to do this afternoon
I have to think this over carefully
I helped my mother with the cooking
I hope they have a pleasant journey
I hope you enjoyed the long weekend
I hope you have a wonderful evening
I hope you will be completely cured
I just told everybody the good news
I just wanted tonight to be perfect
I knew you would do something great
I know some students in that school
I let my emotions cloud my judgment
I like to listen to classical music
I locked myself out of my apartment
I looked for him in the supermarket
I lost my key somewhere around here
I made several mistakes in the exam
I managed to make him understand it
I may have seen that girl somewhere
I missed the last train last Friday
I need someone who can speak French
I never really gave it much thought
I never thought you really did that
I object to being treated like that
I persuaded him to consult a doctor
I really feel like crying right now
I really have to finish my homework
I regret not having kept my promise
I regret saying that you were wrong
I saw Tom dancing with another girl
I should get to Boston by lunchtime
I should probably not be doing this
I spent last Sunday reading a novel
I spent the weekend with my friends
I spent two hours playing the piano
I talked him into selling his house
I taught Tom French for three years
I taught my girlfriend how to drive
I think Tom could make a difference
I think perhaps you should call Tom
I think that fact is very important
I think we can handle the situation
I took a painkiller for my headache
I took two aspirins for my headache
I value our friendship a great deal
I visit my grandmother twice a week
I want to pretend it never happened
I was forced to accept her proposal
I was forced to accept his proposal
I was not conscious of her presence
I was supposed to do that yesterday
I was thinking about asking her out
I was thinking the exact same thing
I wash my hands before eating lunch
I went outside early in the morning
I went skiing in Canada last winter
I will go tomorrow morning at seven
I wonder if this water is drinkable
I wonder when the Civil War started
I work every day except for Sundays
I would like to attend that lecture
I would like to insure this package
I would like to purchase some boots
I would rather have tea than coffee
It does seem like an excellent plan
It is absurd trying to persuade him
It is impossible for you to succeed
It made me forget about my problems
It was yesterday that he went there
It will become much warmer in March
Just act as if nothing has happened
Kyoto is famous for its old temples
Life is often compared to a journey
Lock the window before going to bed
Look up the word in your dictionary
Look up this word in the dictionary
Many runners passed out in the heat
Mary is being careful with her baby
Mary is expecting a baby in October
Men with guns were waiting for them
Money is not a criterion of success
Mother was afraid I would get dirty
My apartment is on the fourth floor
My best friend is currently in Rome
My bicycle was gone when I returned
My brother is a high school student
My camera is much better than yours
My children were taken away from me
My dream is to become a firefighter
My duty is to protect everyone here
My father gave up smoking last year
My father made me a delicious lunch
My father will not be busy tomorrow
My feet are small compared to yours
My husband is always reading in bed
My motorcycle broke down on the way
My sister has become a good pianist
My sister is engaged in social work
My sister plays the piano every day
My wife is hiding something from me
No one believes that he is innocent
No sailboat is faster than this one
Not all criminals should go to jail
Not everybody wants to be an artist
Not everyone who lives here is rich
Open your mouth and close your eyes
Our apartment is on the third floor
Our parents should be taken care of
Our streets flood when we have rain
Our town was bombed twice this week
Perhaps I can be of some assistance
Please lock the door when you leave
Please take more care in the future
Please tell me how to cook sukiyaki
Punish the wicked and save the weak
Put the eggs into the boiling water
Replace the old tires with new ones
Rome has a lot of ancient buildings
Sales fell off in the third quarter
She accused him of stealing her car
She advised him to do more exercise
She advised him to give up drinking
She advised him to read those books
She believes her son is still alive
She blamed him for all her problems
She cooked a special dinner for him
She cooked her husband an apple pie
She gave him something hot to drink
She had time for her favorite hobby
She has a husband and two daughters
She has good control over her class
She has traveled all over the globe
She insisted that he play the piano
She is always free in the afternoon
She is fluent in English and French
She is not anything like her mother
She longs for her husband to arrive
She looked him straight in the eyes
She looks prettier in her red dress
She made the same mistake as before
She parted from her friend in tears
She promised to meet him last night
She should have arrived home by now
She surprised him with a small gift
She takes piano lessons once a week
She talks as if she knew everything
She was a bridesmaid at the wedding
She was having a hard time swimming
She was never seen again after that
Some people compare life to a stage
Some people in the crowd fired back
Some people read books to kill time
Sometimes all we have is our dreams
Take the medicine three times a day
Take your hands out of your pockets
Taste buds are needed to taste food
Telegraph us when you get to Boston
Tell me a little bit about yourself
Ten years have passed since he died
Thank you for inviting me to dinner
Thank you for inviting us to dinner
Thank you very much for inviting me
Thank you very much for your letter
That blue dress suits you very well
That dress looks really nice on you
That is the picture that he painted
That is what they study English for
That love affair is a family secret
That mattress needs to be aired out
That noise is almost driving me mad
The Sphinx began to walk around him
The address on this parcel is wrong
The air conditioner is out of order
The boy was laughed at by everybody
The bus drivers are on strike today
The cat crouched down ready to jump
The cat loves playing in the garden
The city was bombed by enemy planes
The climate is mild in this country
The clock on that tower is accurate
The customs office is at the border
The doctor advised him not to smoke
The doctor cured her of her disease
The dog next door is always barking
The exact same thing happened to me
The farmer plowed his field all day
The game got more and more exciting
The jets took off one after another
The lawn mower needs gas to operate
The leaves on trees have turned red
The lecture covered a lot of ground
The little girl did nothing but cry
The man was a fountain of knowledge
The nightlife is better in New York
The plan has been successful so far
The policeman is wearing a gas mask
The ship is not equipped with radar
The snowstorm raged for a full week
The spy made contact with the enemy
The train is ten minutes late today
The very thought is abhorrent to me
The washing machine is out of order
The wind calmed down in the evening
The workers were naked to the waist
Their house is far from the station
There are no mistakes in your essay
There are some apples in the basket
There is a dragonfly on the ceiling
There is a mistake in this sentence
There is an exception to every rule
There is an urgent need for shelter
There is little water in the bucket
There is no advantage in doing that
There is no answer to your question
There is no doubt about his ability
There is no excuse for your actions
There is no factory in this village
There were no people in the village
There will be a concert next Sunday
These boxes are made out of plastic
They agreed to give us an interview
They can add something if they wish
They cried when they heard the news
They donated money to the Red Cross
They even named their boy after you
They forced me to take the medicine
They hang out together all the time
They have brown skin and black hair
They have drunk two bottles of wine
They hired someone else for the job
They left very early in the morning
They often go on picnics by bicycle
They talked over the plan for hours
This book is not available in Japan
This custom began in the Edo Period
This door is locked from the inside
This house is registered in my name
This is an interesting book to read
This is something I must face alone
This job involves lots of hard work
This law is applicable to all cases
This may just come in handy someday
This poor cat almost died of hunger
This river flows south into the sea
This show is too racy for teenagers

Two families live in the same house
Two people say they heard a gunshot
We are going to climb that mountain
We had a heated discussion about it
We had a short vacation in February
We have been waiting here for hours
We have four classes in the morning
We have had little snow this winter
We have three trees in our backyard
We have to be careful with expenses
We have to be prepared for anything
We heard the boy playing the violin
We invited ten couples to the party
We managed to swim across the river
We must have faith in the president
We need something a bit more subtle
We need to find an effective method
We need to take this very seriously
We sat face to face with executives
We should always try to help others
We should make use of atomic energy
We should talk calmly to each other
We talked about a variety of topics
We want to take your blood pressure
We went on talking about the matter
We were crowded into the small room
We were obliged to abandon our plan
We will visit our teacher next week
Whales are similar to fish in shape
What he said could possibly be true
Whatever can go wrong will go wrong
You are responsible for what you do
You can have this watch for nothing
You have the right to remain silent
You have to choose your own destiny
You have to learn how to compromise
You may bring whoever wants to come
You need to focus on your strengths
You ought to have been more careful
You should have taken a chance then
You should have told me that before
You should not leave the baby alone
You should turn off your cell phone
Your advice is always helpful to me
Your name was dropped from the list
A calamity was avoided by sheer luck
A crowd collected to watch the fight
A gentleman is always kind to others
A girl drowned in the pond yesterday
A heavy rain prevented me from going
A hideous monster used to live there
A lot of tourists invaded the island
A problem shared is a problem halved
A river runs down through the valley
A sleeping child looks like an angel
A team is composed of eleven players
A truck was careering along the road
After lunch we have two more classes
All journeys begin with a first step
All of these meetings are in English
Always being honest is no easy thing
Arabic is written from right to left
Ask at the police station over there
Brush your teeth before going to bed
Butter and cheese are made from milk
By hard work we can achieve anything
Children play in this park every day
China is the biggest country in Asia
China is the largest country in Asia
Close the window before going to bed
Coffee will be served after the meal
Contact me if you have any questions
Do this work by tomorrow if possible
Do your homework before you watch TV
Eating too much may lead to sickness
English is spoken all over the world
Everybody says I look like my father
Everybody wants to live a happy life
Everything I own is in this suitcase
God created the heaven and the earth
God knows we did everything we could
Hand in your homework by next Monday
He acquired French when he was young
He admonished his son for being lazy
He believed that the earth was round
He blamed others for his own failure
He can play both tennis and baseball
He carried the suitcases to our room
He elbowed his way through the crowd
He finally decided to propose to her
He finds fault with everything I say
He finds faults with everything I do
He finished it as quick as lightning

He goes to mass every Sunday morning
He got injured in a traffic accident
He had his secretary type the report

He wiped the sweat from his forehead
Her mother is a most beautiful woman
Her youngest child is five years old
His behavior really got on my nerves
His dog follows him wherever he goes
His essay was full of original ideas
His house is near the subway station
His laptop is already five years old
His mother is worried sick about him
His story is well worth listening to
His way of thinking is very childish
His wounded leg began to bleed again
I already bought my ticket to Boston
I always get nervous in her presence
I always wonder what happened to him
I am not interested in material gain
I appreciate your efforts to help me
I arrived here at eight this morning
I attempted to swim across the river
I attended the meeting on her behalf
I believe in this method of teaching
I bought it for about twelve dollars
I can hardly understand what he says
I feel quite at ease among strangers
I figured you might change your mind
I found it difficult to convince her
I had a bladder infection last month
I had already left when they arrived
I had the strangest dream last night
I have a pretty tight schedule today
I have a tight schedule this weekend
I have never heard him speak English
I have never seen a red refrigerator
I have nothing particular to say now
I have something urgent to attend to
I have things to attend to elsewhere
I have to speak with you immediately
I have until tomorrow to finish this
I have written down his phone number
I hesitated about which road to take
I hope we have fine weather tomorrow
I intended to have finished the work
I know your older brother quite well
I leave the matter to your judgement
I love walking barefoot on the grass
I must have made a mistake somewhere
I must postpone going to the dentist
I must remind you about your promise
I never could hide anything from you
I never thought they would accept me
I no longer believe anything you say
I often do my homework before dinner
I only read the first three chapters
I ordered two teas and three coffees
I passed the test with flying colors
I recommend that you read that novel
I returned the knife that I borrowed
I saw some monkeys climbing the tree
I should probably not have done that
I stayed home because it was raining
I suddenly thought of my dead mother
I suppose I asked too many questions
I think I just heard somebody scream
I think death is preferable to shame
I think you mentioned that last week
I think you should drink some coffee
I thought you lived with your family
I tried everything to keep him alive
I used to listen to English programs
I want to have a telephone installed
I was a volunteer for two afternoons
I was deeply impressed by his speech
I was involved in a traffic accident
I was more than a little embarrassed
I watched TV for two hours yesterday
I watched a Swedish movie last night
I will stand by you whatever happens
I wish I could understand you better
I wonder if anything happened to him
I worked hard all day long yesterday
I would like the least expensive one
I would rather not go shopping alone
Imagine that you have a time machine
It appears that you are all mistaken
It happened at a quarter past eleven
It is completely out of the question
It must have rained during the night
It was surprising that she said that
Japan is at peace with her neighbors
Japan is made up of volcanic islands
Kyoto is the former capital of Japan
Lake Towada is famous for its beauty
Let me help you with those groceries
Look up the words in your dictionary

New stamps will be issued next month
Night watchmen drink a lot of coffee
No attention was paid to his warning
No one I know writes letters anymore
No one ever escapes from this prison
No wonder they turned down her offer
No words can relieve her deep sorrow
None of my classmates live near here
Nothing but peace can save the world
Our football team has a good defense
Our train went through a long tunnel
Patience is a rare virtue these days
People are not always what they seem
Please come again in three days time
Please feel free to ask me questions
Please move your bicycle out of here
Please send me a picture of yourself
Please write your name with a pencil
Popularity has nothing to do with it

She removed the papers from the desk
She returned the book to the library
She spoke scarcely a word of English
She talked him into quitting his job
She told him all about her childhood
She tried to get whatever she wanted
She used to play tennis every Sunday
She wanted to wash the dirty clothes
She was close to breaking into tears
She was satisfied with the new dress
She was stupid enough to believe him
She would often come late for school

We are faced with a difficult choice
We become forgetful as we grow older
We complained that the room was cold
We hardly have time to eat breakfast

We have less than three minutes left
We look forward to getting back home
We must find a more efficient method
We need another person to play cards
We need somebody with bold new ideas
We need to get some medical supplies
We study English every day at school
We were delayed by the heavy traffic
We were not prepared for the assault
We will have little snow this winter
We would often talk about our future
Yesterday was the last day of school
You are always finding fault with me
You did not come to school yesterday
You have to be prepared for anything
You must pay attention to his advice
You must show respect to your guests
You never want to give anything away

You should have kept your mouth shut
You should have shown him the device
You should put your ideas in writing
You should try to write more legibly
You worry about your weight too much
Your dress is already out of fashion
Your dress is touching the wet paint
Your wallet is on the television set

I always wondered what that noise was
I am uncomfortable in these new shoes
I am very interested in these stories
I apologize for the delay in replying
I arrived safe and sound this morning
I ate a hamburger and ordered another
I borrowed the book from this library
I borrowed this comic from his sister
I bought her a nice Christmas present
I called my neighbors over for dinner
I can hardly imagine him going abroad
I can speak neither French nor German
I do remember the incident quite well
I feel like having some pizza tonight
I finally went to England this summer
I forgot how beautiful this place was
I had a strange experience last night
I had forgotten how beautiful you are

I was thinking exactly the same thing
I was welcomed whenever I visited him
I went to elementary school in Nagoya
I will probably get up early tomorrow
I would act differently in your place
I would like to address two questions
I would rather go today than tomorrow

Kyoto was the former capital of Japan
Look up the phrase in your dictionary
Look up these words in the dictionary

Maybe you should just leave Tom alone
Maybe your earring is under the table

Most of the policemen lost their jobs
Most young people have a mobile phone

She always says nice things about him
She always takes care of her children
She changed her schedule to match his
She complained to him about the noise
She decided not to attend the meeting
She divided the cake into five pieces
She expected him to solve the problem
She had to choose her words carefully
She has always been a popular actress
She has not finished her homework yet
She herself gave him something to eat
She is collecting material for a book

I want you to go see the nurse
I was a little put out by this
I was one of the last to leave
I was saved as if by a miracle
I was told to wait for a while
I went by bus as far as London
I wish I could be in Paris now
I wish I could go back in time
I wish I had a friend like you
I wish I had had a camera then
It is about the size of an egg
It is high time we went to bed
It is our duty to obey the law
It is really time for us to go
It was her wish to go to Paris
It was his wish to go to Paris
Let me show you how to do that
Riding a horse is a lot of fun
She brought a cup of tea to me
She sat next to him on the bus
She used to be a very shy girl
She was in the mood for a walk
Tell me what you want me to do
The boss gave us all a day off
They told me I had to help you
This car is as big as that car
This is the book I want to buy
This is what I do for a living
Tom has done what he had to do
Tom has to go even if it rains
Tom is a bit short for his age
Tom is a bit small for his age
Tom is a lot shorter than I am
Tom is angry a lot of the time
Tom is not able to drive a car
Tom is on the go day and night
Tom is too far away to hear us
Tom said he had a lot of money
Tom seems to have it in for me
Tom told me he used to be rich
We had a lot of rain last year
We had a lot of snow last year
We have no choice but to do so
We need a tool to open it with
We still have a long way to go
You can get a loan from a bank
You may as well get used to it
You may use my pen at any time
You need a key to open the box
A lot of my hair has fallen out
A rat chewed a hole in the wall
All I can do is work in silence
All of us live in the same dorm
All you have to do is follow me
Come and see me once in a while
Cookie is a good name for a dog
Either you or I will have to go
He can cook as well as his wife
He did it in front of the staff
He gave her a peck on the cheek
He gave his seat to the old man
He has been like a father to me
He is going to explain it to me
He is not as tall as his father
He is old enough to drive a car
He left for New York a week ago
He lives at the top of the hill
He made up his mind to go there
He showed me how to make a cake
He stood at the end of the line
He threw a stone at the big dog
He took the eggs out one by one
He tried to get rid of the ants
He tried to put the blame on me
He wants to get rid of the ants
He was in time for the last bus
He will be here in half an hour
He will come back in a few days
He writes to me once in a while
His old car is on its last legs
I am afraid I must be going now
I am badly in need of your help
I am too tired to walk any more
I am very sorry for what I said
I asked him if he would help me
I asked my boss for a pay raise
I asked what he was going to do
I blew on my hands to warm them
I came here of my own free will
I came to talk to you about Tom
I can only tell you what I know
I can see a ship on the horizon
I do not like any of these hats
I doubt if he will come on time
I explained why we had to do it
I feel like I let the team down
I feel there is just no way out
I felt a sudden pain in my side
I found the man I want to marry
I gave her a comic book to read
I go for a walk every other day
I go to the barber once a month
I go to the movies once a month
I go to work every day by train
I got a nasty sting from a wasp
I got my son to repair the door
I got up to go and look outside
I had a hunch you would do that
I had a lot of fun last weekend
I had a problem to take care of
I had issues I had to deal with
I had no idea Tom would do that
I had no idea you felt that way
I had no idea you were so young
I had things I had to deal with
I had to beg my friends to come
I had to wait for Tom to finish
I hate that you have to be here
I have a great deal to do today
I have a lot in common with him
I have a rough idea where it is
I have a sharp pain in my chest
I have a twitch in my right eye
I have a week to do my homework
I have as many books as he does
I have no one to say goodbye to
I have some stuff to do at home
I have to be back home by seven
I have to go back to the office
I heard you paid a visit to Tom
I just figured out how to do it
I just got here a few hours ago
I just want to be a good person
I just want to get it over with
I just want to get my work done
I just want to go back to class
I just want to have a good time
I just want you out of my house
I just want you to listen to me
I knew this was a waste of time
I know I got it right this time
I know how we can have some fun
I learned that when I was a kid
I look on you as my best friend
I love you just the way you are
I met him on my way from school
I met him while he was in Japan
I need to talk to you in person
I only did it for your own good
I only feed my dog dry dog food
I only wish I were able to help
I paid a lot of money for these
I saw his car make a right turn
I suggest we go out for a drink
I think Tom is in love with you
I think this is a waste of time
I think we have a lot in common
I thought Tom said it was a dog
I told you to stay away from me
I told you to stay in the house
I took the cake out of the oven
I want to be in your life again
I want to do this the right way
I want to go back to my cubicle
I want to know how they do that
I want to know why you did that
I want to marry a girl like her
I want to sit down for a change
I want you to tell me the truth
I wanted to sell Tom my old car
I was home for a couple of days
I was quite at a loss for words
I was very rich until I met her
I went out in spite of the rain
I will be able to pass the test
I will buy a watch at the store
I will give you what help I can
I will go to New York next week
I will see him after I get back
I will show you how to solve it
I wish I had been with her then
I wish I had more money with me
I wish I knew what I should say
I would like you to sing a song
It is high time you went to bed
It is high time you were in bed
It is rare for him to get angry
It looks a lot worse than it is
It may be that he likes his job
It rains a lot in June in Japan
It was impolite of him to do so
It was kind of you to invite us
Let me give you a bit of advice
Let me know as soon as he comes
Let me know as soon as you know
Let me know what you want to do
My advice is for you to go home
My house is close to a bus stop
My mother died when I was a kid
My work is not as easy as yours
Please bring a cup of tea to me
She and I are in the same class
She has the air of being a lady
She is as thin as a broom stick
She is on a diet to lose weight
She told us not to make a noise
She wrote to me to come at once
Show me the way to the bus stop
That is not what I meant to say
That is the book I want to read
The eagle had to be fed by hand
The girl had a large red hat on
The ice is too thin to skate on
The news is too good to be true
The one who said that is a liar
The two of them are in the room
The wound left a scar on my arm
There is a red rose in the vase
They sat on a bench in the park
They told me to stay in the car
This bed is way too soft for me
This is the book I want to read
This one is as good as that one
Tom and I are in the same class
Tom did all he could do to help
Tom has done the best he can do
Tom has put his car up for sale
Tom has told me a lot about you
Tom is going to make it on time
Tom is the best man for the job
Tom told me not to talk to Mary
Tom wants you to do him a favor
Try to see how far you can jump
We can depend on her to help us
We had a lot of rain last month
We have to learn how to do that
We have to make sure we do that
We hit it off right off the bat
We just have to get out of here
We look up to Tom as our leader
We look up to him as our leader
We may as well keep it a secret
We saw the child get on the bus
We use a lot of water every day
We went for a walk on the beach
You are always as busy as a bee
You are twice as strong as I am
You can eat as much as you want
You can rent a boat by the hour
A chain is made up of many links
A dog has a sharp sense of smell
Be quiet and get back in the car
Both of us want to see the movie
Call me when you are ready to go
Either you or I have to go there
He asked me if I knew his father
He asked me to pass him the salt
He did exactly as I had told him
He died of old age two years ago
He gave body and soul to his job
He goes to a school for the deaf
He had a good look at the papers
He had never seen such a bad boy
He has a lot of books on history
He has a very dry sense of humor
He has been sick for a long time
He has been sick in bed all week
He has his hair cut once a month
He has no house in which to live
He has the ability to do the job
He has the least money of us all
He has the same camera as I have
He is a student at a high school
He is always making a fool of me
He is fond of this kind of music
He is not as tall as his brother
He is twice as heavy as his wife
He let the dog loose in the yard
He made up a story about the dog
He made up his mind to marry her
He raised his hat when he saw me
He robbed me of every cent I had
He sat at the edge of the stream
He talks as if he were a teacher
He taught me how to write a poem
He told me he would go to Venice
He told me not to drive too fast
He told me the story of his life
He took a coin out of his pocket
He wants to get rid of his books
He was busy when I called him up
He was holding a pen in his hand
He was worn out when he got home
He went out in spite of the rain
He went to see her the other day
He will be in time for the train
He wrote to me from time to time
I agreed to help him in his work
I allowed her to go to the party
I am leaving town for a few days
I am married and I have two sons
I am taking a couple of days off
I am thankful for the food I eat
I am very glad to meet you today
I asked Tom to keep an open mind
I asked him not to drive so fast
I can hear the wind in the trees
I do not have anything in my bag
I do not think that he will come
I expect you all to do your best
I feel dizzy every time I get up
I felt like going out for a walk
I figured it would be easy to do
I forgot what I was going to say
I found her cat in an empty room
I get up at six almost every day
I got a lot of mail this morning
I got up while it was still dark
I had no idea things were so bad
I had no idea you were so stupid
I had to do everything on my own
I have a brand new pair of socks
I have a desire to go to England
I have a hunch that it will rain
I have enough money to buy a car
I have left my umbrella in a bus
I have looked for it up and down
I have never fed my dog a banana
I have no idea of what to expect
I have no time to do my homework
I have plenty of time to do that
I have to be there for my family
I have to go and buy a newspaper
I just got a call from my office
I just want to go home and sleep
I just want to hang out with you
I just want to have a little fun
I just want to take a quick look
I just wanted to see if you knew
I know this must come as a shock
I know you want to make me happy
I left one of my books at school
I like to cook all kinds of food
I lived in this house as a child
I lost sight of her in the crowd
I love you more than you love me
I made the best of my small room
I meant to have that done by now
I might as well get a head start
I need some sugar to make a cake
I need someone who I can talk to
I never want to see you get sick
I plan to go to France next year
I ran all the way to the station
I read the whole book in one day
I saw a bum at the train station
I saw a koala for the first time
I seem to have caught a bad cold
I talked to my friend in the FBI
I think I could get used to this
I think Tom had a real good year
I think Tom is a really nice kid
I think Tom is going to call you
I think Tom is in the front yard
I think life is what you make it
I think we should go take a look
I thought I might be of some use
I thought it would be easy to do
I told Tom to take off his shoes
I used to go to church on Sunday
I want to ask you one last favor
I want to go back to my quarters
I want to go somewhere on a trip
I want to go to America some day
I want to know how you know that
I want to know what time to come
I want to know who paid for this
I want to know who told you that
I want to know who was in charge
I want to learn to sing like you
I want to punch you in your face
I want to see him no matter what
I want to speak to my lawyer now
I want to spend my life with you
I want to write all of this down
I want you out of here right now
I want you to be my friend again
I want you to call off the fight
I want you to come to my wedding
I want you to get your own place
I want you to lay back and relax
I want you to stay here with her
I want you to stay where you are
I want you to take this with you
I wanted to get my mind off work
I wanted to have a beer with you
I was allowed to take a week off
I was in the hospital for a week
I was just thinking of a new job
I was too tired to walk any more
I was very glad to hear the news
I went to Tokyo to buy this book
I went to the scene of the crime
I will go there even if it rains
I wish I could go to the concert
I wish I could go with you today
I wish I had been there with you
I wish you had told me the truth
I wish you were here with me now
I wonder if you ever think of me
I would do anything to get a job
I would lay down my life for you
I would like to come and see you
I would like you to come with me
I would like you to stay with me
It is Paris that I want to visit
It is impossible for me to do so
It is no use asking me for money
It is obvious that that is a lie
It is safe to skate on this lake
It is said that he was very rich
It seems to me that he is honest
It seems we are in the same boat
It was that dog that bit my hand
It was the best night of my life
It would be nice to have a party
It would only be a waste of time
Let me help you put on your coat
Mary is the kind of woman I like
My dad is not home at the moment
My house is a long way from here
My uncle gave me a pair of shoes
No doubt she will win in the end
No one listens to me when I talk
Now tell us what we want to know
Open the door and let in the dog
Our debt is more than we can pay
She came to see me the other day
She gave me a nice pair of shoes
She has had quite a lot to drink
She has the same bag as you have
She is not a poet but a novelist
She is the one who feeds our dog
She likes to dress up as a nurse
She was advised by him not to go
Taking a taxi is a luxury for me
Tell me why you want to go there
Ten years is a long time to wait
That was what I was going to say
The fuel tank in the car is full
The lake is a long way from here
The man took the boy by the hand
The moment he saw me he ran away
The old castle is in a sad state
The road turns a bit to the west
The truck cut in front of my car
The two of us split up last year
The wound left a scar on her arm
There is no need for him to work
There is no need for us to hurry
They are the ones who want to go
They were in a hurry to get home
This bed is too hard to sleep on
This book is easy for me to read
This book is hard for me to read
This desk is a little low for me
This doll is a gift from my aunt
This is all that is known so far
This is the house he was born in
This is the reason why he did it
This is what I found in the cave
Tom can ski just as well as Mary
Tom had to spend a night in jail
Tom has a tattoo on his left arm
Tom is a member of the SWAT team
Tom is never at a loss for words
Tom is on his way back to Boston
Tom is the right man for the job
Tom is too young to go to school
Tom looks just like a guy I know
Tom needs us to show him the way
Tom poured a cup of tea for Mary
Tom put a flea collar on his dog
Tom said he wants to talk to you
Tom sat on a stool in the corner
Tom says he can wait a long time
Tom should ask Mary how to do it
Tom told me not to lock the door
Tom will be in Boston for a week
Tom woke up at the crack of dawn
We had lots of fun at the picnic
We have to do this the right way
We have to find out who did this
We look up to him as our teacher
We need to get you to a hospital
We need to make up for lost time
We spent the day in the open air
We stayed at a hotel by the lake
We still have a lot of food left
We stood on the brink of a cliff
We want to buy a house in Boston
We went for a walk in the forest
What he needs most is a good job
You all know what you have to do
You can go to the station by bus
You can stay as long as you like
You did it in front of the staff
You get out only what you put in
You have only to watch what I do
You have to see it to believe it
You may stay here if you want to
You may talk as much as you like
You ought not to stay up so late
You talk as if you were the boss
A bear will not touch a dead body
A few were drunk most of the time
A rack of lamb makes a great meal
A stranger spoke to me in the bus
A stranger spoke to me on the bus
A war may break out at any moment
All I found is a pair of scissors
Come and see me any time you like
Drop me a line when you get there
Each one of us should do his best
Either you or she has to go there
Get in the car and lock the doors
He applied for the job and got it
He asked me what I had been doing
He asked us not to make any noise
He blew on the tip of his fingers
He can sing better than any of us
He devoted a lot of time to study
He died and his soul went to hell
He does not seem to be very tired
He drinks a lot of milk every day
He felt a sharp pain in his chest
He filled up the hole in the wall
He gave me a good piece of advice
He gave me food and money as well
He gave us quite a lot of trouble
He gets his hair cut once a month
He has a few friends in this town
He has a very good sense of humor
He has coached us for half a year
He has the ability to do the work
He is learning how to drive a car
He is not as clever as my brother
He is not scared of snakes at all
He is the best player on our team
He is the son of a wealthy family
He is to come to my house tonight
He is too young to go there alone
He paid his loan back to the bank
He raised his hand to stop a taxi
He ran a great risk in the jungle
He showed me the way to the store
He speaks as if he were an expert
He stared at me from head to foot
He stood on the edge of the cliff
He talks as if he knew the secret
He took a room at the Yaesu Hotel
He tried to make up for lost time
He was at work till late at night
He was too tired to walk any more
He will go to New York next month
He will have to go to the station
His son had been killed in a duel
I am allowed to swim in the river
I am fed up with this wet weather
I am going to a concert next week
I am not about to pay ten dollars
I am ready to do anything for you
I am too tired to keep on walking
I asked my father to buy this toy
I bought this coat at a low price
I do not doubt that he is sincere
I feel like I could sleep all day
I figured I could be of some help
I figured I might be able to help
I forgot to tell Tom when to come
I forgot to tell you when to come
I found the key I was looking for
I get drunk at least once a month
I got a long letter from my folks
I got a temporary job at the firm
I got my leg hurt in the accident
I had a feeling you would be late
I had a good time during the trip
I had a little help from a friend
I had a situation to take care of
I had him write the letter for me
I had my wallet stolen on the bus
I had no idea what I should write
I had problems I had to deal with
I had some things to take care of
I hate it when Tom and Mary fight
I have a great deal to do tonight
I have a lot of problems to solve
I have a score to settle with him
I have good news in store for you
I have known that for a long time
I have lived here for a long time
I have many friends I can talk to
I have no idea what that could be
I have no idea what the reason is
I have no idea who that is either
I have no more money in my wallet
I have no one to blame but myself
I have not been busy for two days
I have seen him once on the train
I have someone I want you to meet
I have to find someone to help me
I hear a dog barking in the woods
I hung my coat in the hall closet
I just bought a new pair of shoes
I just got a call from the police
I just had to see this for myself
I just have one other thing to do
I just want Tom to leave me alone
I just want a little more of that
I just want them both to be happy
I just want to be a good neighbor
I just want to live a normal life
I just want you to think about it
I knew this day was going to come
I knew this would be hard for you
I know Tom talks about Mary a lot
I know exactly where I want to go
I know the cure for what ails you
I know what the three of you want
I learned a lot from what I heard
I left my address book in my room
I like to relax with a good novel
I love you more and more each day
I met Tom at his office in Boston
I met an old man near the station
I met her on a certain winter day
I met him on the street by chance
I met him then for the first time
I need to get to this meeting now
I need to put the children to bed
I never want to talk to you again
I played with the baby on my knee
I read a lot of books last summer
I repaid him the money I owed him
I saw a cat running after the dog
I saw a dog swim across the river
I screamed at the top of my lungs
I think I look fat in these jeans
I think Tom did a really nice job
I think Tom did the best he could
I think Tom is going to come back
I think Tom wants to come with us
I think he is something of a poet
I think he will come to our party
I think that Tom is an honest man
I think that might be a good idea
I think you and he wanna be alone
I think you ought to rest a while
I thought I might be able to help
I thought Tom would be at the bar
I thought it might be of some use
I want my father to see the movie
I want to hear you play the piano
I want to keep on living with him
I want to know where it came from
I want to name the baby after you
I want to talk to you after class
I want to thank you for your time
I want you all to be very careful
I want you to find out about that
I want you to keep your eyes open
I want you to listen to this song
I want you to look out the window
I want you to return to your seat
I wanted to make you feel at home
I wanted you to have a little fun
I was born the year the war ended
I was chained to the desk all day
I was moved to tears by the story
I was really young when I met you
I went for a drive in the country
I went to the park to play tennis
I will pick him up at the station
I wish I had asked you for advice
I would like to make a phone call
I would like to see Tom once more
It appears that he was in a hurry
It is a great pleasure to be here
It is a very difficult job for us
It is hard for me to believe this
It is impossible for him to do it
It is impossible for you to do so
It is not far away from the hotel
It is not good to laugh at others
It is time you told her the truth
It is too cold for a picnic today
It is too expensive for me to buy
It is useless to go on strike now
It is very hard to date this vase
It looks like we fell into a trap
It looks like you had a tough day
It seems that I have lost my keys
It seems to me that you are wrong
It was almost noon when I woke up
It was proved that he was a thief
It was quite dark when I got home
It would be sad if that were true
John is two years older than I am
Keep it in mind for the next time
Keep your room as neat as you can
Kobe is the city where I was born
Let me tell you how I really feel
My family will be away for a week
My father has a blue and gray tie
My house is only a mile from here
My mother died when I was a child
My mother told me to mow the lawn
My shoes are the same size as his
No one I know wears a tie anymore
No one told me that he had failed
No stars could be seen in the sky
Not a sound was heard in the room
One is red and the other is white
One word is enough for a wise man
She asked him to not quit his job
She asked me to pass her the salt
She gave me a bag made of leather
She goes to a school for the deaf
She grew up to be a famous doctor
She had only a small sum of money
She has known him for a long time
She has put her house up for sale
She left her son alone in the car
She made him a cake for his party
She made up her mind to go abroad
She stole a lot of money from him
She wanted him to sing her a song
She wants him to be just a friend
She was not in the mood for lunch
She was on the point of going out
She was sore at me for being late
She was the first one to help him
She went to a movie the other day
She went to see him the other day
Six months is a long time to wait
Smoking will do you a lot of harm
Some of us might be willing to go
Taking care of the baby is my job
That is not how we do things here
That will cost you a lot of money
The boy has never been to the zoo
The boy told me why he was crying
The money on the desk is not mine
The old man gave her a small doll
The plan calls for a lot of money
There are a few boats on the lake
There is no need to talk about it
There was a lot of snow last year
There was no one else on the road
They did it in front of the staff
They just want to get to know you
They made me wait for a long time
They stood on the top of the hill
They want to talk to you a moment
This is all that I know about him
This is too good a chance to miss
Tom died with a knife in his back
Tom does only what he wants to do
Tom got a job at a local pizzeria
Tom got up and walked to the door
Tom had no idea how rich Mary was
Tom is both a doctor and a writer
Tom is kind of worked up about it
Tom is on the swim team at school
Tom knows how to have a good time
Tom met Mary on his way to school
Tom met Mary on the way to school
Tom opened the car door to get in
Tom put on a pair of latex gloves
Tom saw a play in the new theater
Tom still has the book I lent him
Tom was the first boy to hug Mary
Tom was the only one in the house
Traveling by boat is a lot of fun
Try to make the most of your time
Twelve years old is old for a dog
We are all eager to see the movie
We are not here for fun and games
We ate a nice meal and drank wine
We feed our dog three times a day
We found a nail stuck in the tire
We found that we had lost our way
We have just a tiny bit of garden
We have no choice but to carry on
We have plenty of time to do that
We must ask the bank for the loan
We want to talk to you about that
We will leave as soon as he comes
We will take care of this for you
What I really want to do is sleep
What I want to know are the facts
You can see it with the naked eye
You have only to ask for his help
You know what song I want to sing
You may as well tell me the truth
You may not be as lucky next time
You must do exactly as I tell you
You need a license to drive a car
You need to stop saying no to Tom
You ought not to make fun of them
You said your boss was a nice guy
You were told to stay on the ship
Your being here means a lot to me
A cat came out from under the desk
A hug from you would make me happy
A man came to visit you last night
All of us were shocked by the news
All of us will die sooner or later
All you have to do is study harder
Call me up at seven in the morning
Cheese is easy to cut with a knife
Each of the three boys got a prize
Each of the three boys won a prize
Give me some time to think it over
Give me what you have in your hand
He and his friend sat on the bench
He came in spite of the heavy snow
He censured me for what I had done
He chipped the edge of the tea cup
He could read me like an open book
He declined the offer and so did I
He did his best only to fail again
He did the reverse of what I asked
He died on the day his son arrived
He earns his living as a hotel boy
He gave an angry shake of his head
He gave me clothes as well as food
He grabbed the chance to get a job
He has been in Japan for two years
He has much more money than I have
He hurried in order to get the bus
He hurt his left foot when he fell
He hurt his left hand with a knife
He is afraid to fly in an airplane
He is likely to be late for school
He is looked up to as their leader
He is madly in love with that girl
He is not interested in art at all
He is not old enough to live alone
He is supposed to be at home today
He kept me waiting for a long time
He kept us waiting for a long time
He left a large fortune to his son
He let his books fall to the floor
He let the dog loose in the garden
He looked at her from head to foot
He lost his temper and hit the boy
He played a minor part in the play
He read the poem with a loud voice
He said it was out of the question
He saw suicide as the only way out
He seems to have no sense of humor
He sent money to help care for her
He stared at her hand for a moment
He stood up and took a deep breath
He stood with his back to the wall
He suggested that we go for a swim
He taught me how to spell the word
He uses a pencil with a fine point
He warned us not to enter the room
He was left all alone in the woods
He was reading a book at that time
He was too tired to go any farther
He was too tired to go any further
He was walking in front of the car
He was weak from the loss of blood
His room is twice as large as mine
I advised him to come back at once
I am able to swim across the river
I am afraid he will make a mistake
I am afraid that he might get hurt
I am afraid that you will get lost
I am afraid to jump over the ditch
I am going to leave my present job
I am grateful to you for your help
I am not always at home on Sundays
I am on good terms with my brother
I am taking a holiday at the beach
I am unable to agree on that point
I am very tired from the hard work
I am waiting for the store to open
I asked my teacher what to do next
I buy loads of stuff at that store
I can hardly make out what he says
I can not bear this noise any more
I can run the fastest of the three
I carried the heavy bag on my back
I caught sight of her in the crowd
I expect to take a vacation in May
I fell down the stairs in my haste
I found a rare stamp at that store
I found it necessary to get a loan
I found it while I was cleaning up
I found no money left in my pocket
I gave the beggar what money I had
I go to the beach almost every day
I got a call from her this morning
I got a call from the school today
I had a dream about you last night
I had no idea you were so ruthless
I had this suit custom made for me
I had to park two blocks from here
I had too much to drink last night
I hate the guy who lives next door
I have a friend who lives in Tokyo
I have a son in junior high school
I have an idea she will come today
I have an uncle who lives in Kyoto
I have been silent for a long time
I have heard quite a lot about you
I have some things to take care of
I have the same trouble as you had
I have to get away from this place
I have to go to the police station
I hear from him every now and then
I heard a young girl call for help
I hope that she will get well soon
I hope that you will get well soon
I hope to own my own house someday
I hope you are not catching a cold
I insist that he should go with us
I just found out what was going on
I just got a call from your school
I just had a talk with your doctor
I just had a talk with your lawyer
I just need to blow off some steam
I just want to be a little happier
I just want to know what to expect
I just wanted a shoulder to cry on
I just wanted to have a little fun
I know how important Tom is to you
I know the house where he was born
I know what you want to talk about
I like rice more than I like bread
I like what you did with your hair
I love you more and more every day
I loved reading when I was a child
I made a lot of mistakes back then
I made an effort to finish my work
I may not get anything I asked for
I meet him on occasion at the club
I need some time to think about it
I need to ask you a silly question
I no longer want to live in Boston
I only found out a couple days ago
I ought to have told her the truth
I owe what I am today to education
I pawned my guitar to pay the rent
I persuaded him to go to the party
I plan to go to her cocktail party
I planted an apple tree in my yard
I play the guitar in my spare time
I put on a little weight last year
I raised my hand to ask a question
I ran upstairs two steps at a time
I remember that I gave him the key
I saw Tom sitting in the third row
I saw my sister tear up the letter
I saw some cars in the parking lot
I spoke to Tom about what Mary did
I suggest that we go out on Friday
I think Tom may be right this time
I think he will object to our plan
I think that will be all for today
I think we both know how Tom feels
I think we should get back to work
I think we should sell our old car
I think what Tom is doing is great
I think what you want is over here
I think you had better take a rest
I thought Tom was going to be here
I thought we were all going to die
I thought we were on the same side
I took the little girl by the hand
I tried to write with my left hand
I want to be very clear about that
I want to finish this work by five
I want to hear all about your trip
I want to help you figure this out
I want to meet people and have fun
I want to see what there is inside
I want to spend some time with you
I want to stay at the Hilton Hotel
I want to tell you a strange thing
I want us all under one roof again
I want you out of here by tomorrow
I want you to come with us tonight
I wanted to make a few phone calls
I was able to find out his address
I was able to play piano very well
I was almost afraid to talk to you
I was fortunate to find a good job
I was glad to hear of your success
I was in London most of the summer
I was just going to write a letter
I was moved to tears by her speech
I was thinking of buying a new car
I was young and I needed the money
I went to bed at twelve last night
I went to see his sister last week
I went to the mall with my friends
I will be glad to help you anytime
I will call in order to confirm it
I will go cycling even if it rains
I will make every effort to get it
I will teach you how to play chess
I wish I had time for a girlfriend
I wish you could have come with me
It began to rain before I got home
It cost a lot more than I expected
It happened to me about a year ago
It is true that he won first prize
It is true that the earth is round
It may already be too late for him
It reminds me of the good old days
It saddens me to hear you say that
It seems that he is unable to swim
It seems to me that you are honest
It took courage to do what Tom did
It was Tom that told me this story
It was Tom who helped us find Mary
It was his first trip as a captain
It would be crazy to do that again
Lend him as much money as he needs
Look at the sign just ahead of you
Mary knows how to have a good time
Miyazaki is not what it used to be
My brother gave me a pair of jeans
My car is parked not far from here
My daughter is the apple of my eye
My dream is to go to Japan someday
My room is twice as large as yours
My sister and I went to the castle
My sister likes melons and so do I
My sister saw it with her own eyes
My sister showed a new watch to me
My uncle has a farm in the village
Never hit a man who can fight back
No one here seems to want our help
No one told me that she had failed
None of this makes any sense to me
Nothing can force me to give it up
One of my friends bought a red car
Our team is likely to win the game
Please move the TV set to the left
Please move to the rear of the bus
Please write to me once in a while
Put the chair in front of the desk
Put this book on top of the others
She found a need and she filled it
She gave birth to twins a week ago
She gave him money as well as food
She goes to the movies once a week
She got into the car and drove off
She got to the hotel late at night
She got up at seven in the morning
She had to take care of her sister
She has a piano lesson once a week
She has never sung a song with him
She is going to learn how to drive
She is learning how to drive a car
She is too young to know the truth
She lost her son in a car accident
She may not be aware of the danger
She parked her car in a vacant lot
She put her head out of the window
She reminded him to go to the bank
She seems to be living by the lake
She spends a lot of money on books
She spends a lot of money on shoes
She was lying face down on the bed
She was similar to me in many ways
She was too tired to go on working
She will come even if she is tired
That is the house where I was born
That is why he was late for school
That jacket is way too big for you
That would be nice if it were true
The boy caught the cat by the tail
The boy has an apple in his pocket
The bus stops in front of my house
The cat dug its claws into my hand
The cause of the fire is not known
The child threw a stone at the dog
The diamond was set in a gold ring
The door opened and a man came out
The lion is the king of the beasts
The lion is the king of the jungle
The money has been put to good use
The offer is too good to turn down
The play was based on a true story
The price of oil is down this week
The price of this car is very high
The sky was clear when I left home
The teacher and I sat face to face
The trip will take at least a week
There are a lot of parks in London
There are lots of eggs in that box
There was a ton of pressure on him
They all stood up at the same time
They climbed to the top of a cliff
They did not have much food to eat
They want us to come in right away
This bomb can kill a lot of people
This is always the way it has been
This is someone I want you to meet
This is the dress I made last week
This is the girl you wanted to see
This is the hospital I was born in
This is the house where I was born
This is the place I told Tom about
This is the place I told you about
This is the town where he was born
This might not be such a good idea
Those who want to remain may do so
Three hours is a long time to wait
Tom asked Mary why she was so late
Tom asked me to give you a message
Tom can ski as well as his brother
Tom expected it to cost a lot more
Tom gave Mary all the money he had
Tom had no idea how tired Mary was
Tom has barely said a word all day
Tom has caused me a lot of trouble
Tom is a much better liar than you
Tom is always one step ahead of us
Tom is three years older than I am
Tom knew where he had put his keys
Tom knows how to tell a good story
Tom likes Mary just the way she is
Tom likes to do things his own way
Tom lives on the same street as me
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea
Tom said that the soup was too hot
Tom stole a lot of money from Mary
Tom told Mary not to wait for John
Tom told us that he had a headache
Tom tried in vain to hide his pain
Tom used to come here all the time
Tom wanted to turn over a new leaf
Tom wants me to stay away from him
Tom wants to buy a house in Boston
Tom will be happy to see you again
Tom wrote a lot of letters to Mary
Turn off the light and go to sleep
We all need help from time to time
We are about to sit down to dinner
We are all eager to know the truth
We are in the era of atomic energy
We are looking for a place to stay
We can talk about it in the future
We had a very good time last night
We had a very hot summer this year
We have a long journey ahead of us
We have to come together as a team
We have to get you to the hospital
We have to weigh the pros and cons
We just want you to tell the truth
We need a bit more time to prepare
We owe part of our success to luck
We still have to look for the hook
We want you to be the team captain
We were on the train for ten hours
We will make every effort to do so
What he said turned out to be true
What he says makes no sense at all
You are now on the way to recovery
You are trusted by every one of us
You can go wherever you want to go
You can have someone do it for you
You can pick out any book you like
You can stay only if you are quiet
You can stay with us for the night
You can trust him to keep his word
You have been a great mentor to me
You must get rid of that bad habit
You ought to be quiet in a library
You should try to be more like Tom
You will never be too old to learn
Your son must be quite tall by now
A cat was sleeping in the bass drum
A cold wind was blowing on his face
A friend in need is a friend indeed
A home is more than a mere building
A hot bath made me feel much better
A lot of jobs are done by computers
A lot of people applied for the job
A lot of people are waiting for Tom
A monkey is climbing up a tall tree
A red light was glowing in the dark
All you can do is trust one another
Ask him when the next plane will be
Come see me if you are free tonight
Everyone is going to call me a liar
He and I are almost the same height
He blew out the candles on the cake
He came to London by way of Siberia
He comes to see me nearly every day
He could not find what I had hidden
He did nothing but watch TV all day
He doubts if I will keep my promise
He drew a straight line on the wall
He earns three times more than I do
He explained to my son why it rains
He fell ill because he ate too much
He finally found out how to make it
He gave me what little money he had
He got hurt in the accident at work
He got the book down from the shelf
He had an operation on his left leg
He had plenty of money for his trip
He had the gall to ignore my advice
He has more money than can be spent
He has more money than he can spend
He is ahead of his class in English
He is always taking a nap at school
He is capable of doing such a thing
He is what we call a musical genius
He locked up his jewels in the safe
He offered his seat to an old woman
He often goes to the library by car
He plays the piano better than I do
He said two or three words and left
He seems to know all about her past
He showed me how to use this camera
He stood on the surface of the moon
He swam until he could swim no more
He told me that his father was dead
He told me to leave the window open
He uses the same dictionary as I do
He wants the most bang for his buck
He wants to go to the United States
He wants to spend time with his son
He was ashamed of the grades he got
He was born and brought up in Tokyo
He was in favor of equality for all
He was kind enough to lend me money
He went to bed at eleven last night
He went to bed because he was tired
Her mother has made her what she is
His hair is black in color and long
His success was in part due to luck
I always catch a cold in the winter
I am all alone in a foreign country
I am almost scared to talk with you
I am going to watch TV this evening
I am really pleased with my new car
I am sorry to have kept you waiting
I am very pleased with my new house
I asked Tom if he needed more money
I asked him if he would return soon
I asked you if you wanted some help
I banged my leg on the coffee table
I believe that he is a reliable man
I can assure you that you are wrong
I can walk to school in ten minutes
I consider Tom to be my best friend
I could never do that sort of thing
I could not afford to buy a bicycle
I could use a little help over here
I cried when Tom told me about that
I decided on telling her of my love
I doubt Tom really needs to do that
I expected you to be here for lunch
I fell in love in an unlikely place
I felt a light touch on my shoulder
I figured you must be hungry by now
I had a hard time finding his house
I had a quarrel with him over money
I had my licence renewed a week ago
I had no idea you were so dedicated
I had some problems to take care of
I had to get something from my room
I have a round trip ticket to Tokyo
I have an account at that book shop
I have been in Japan for two months
I have kept a diary for three years
I have nothing to do with that case
I have nothing to do with the crime
I have read every book on the shelf
I have read that story in some book
I have something I want to tell you
I hear that she is a famous actress
I highly doubt Tom wants to see you
I hope Tom never gets out of prison
I hope to see you again before long
I just got a call from the hospital
I just had a talk with your teacher
I just want to see what will happen
I just want you to think about that
I let my sister use my new computer
I lied to my boyfriend about my age
I like the slow rhythm of that song
I like things just the way they are
I made sure no one was following me
I may know someone who can help you
I met her on the street by accident
I need a hacksaw to finish this job
I need thread to sew on this button
I never have had occasion to use it
I never let anyone else feed my dog
I never said this job would be easy
I no longer have the energy to talk
I no longer wish to be your husband
I only quit because you asked me to
I opened the drawer to get a pencil
I overslept so I was late to school
I persuaded him to give up the idea
I read the book from cover to cover
I really need to be alone right now
I really want to get this work done
I regret that I did not work harder
I saw an old woman cross the street
I saw him walking alone in the park
I should go home and get some sleep
I stayed at home because I was sick
I studied hard when I was in school
I suppose you want to use my office
I think Tom said he was from Boston
I think the box has something in it
I think what Tom did was very brave
I think you know what you should do
I think you need someone to talk to
I thought a lot about what Tom said
I thought a lot about what you said
I tried to imagine life on the moon
I used to take a walk every morning
I want her to do the difficult work
I want it to be different this time
I want my dinner brought to my room
I want to dedicate this song to him
I want to go to school in Australia
I want to hear more about your trip
I want to know exactly what you did
I want to know where you heard that
I want to know who your friends are
I want to learn how to speak French
I want to live close to the station
I want to make sure there is enough
I want to send this letter to Japan
I want to take a nice long vacation
I want you to leave my family alone
I wanted to go back to your village
I was able to swim across the river
I was in bed all day long yesterday
I was just trying to stop the fight
I was meaning to ask you about that
I was puzzled about what to do next
I went to drink a beer with friends
I will be in high school next April
I will do whatever I think is right
I will finish the work in five days
I will go even if it rains tomorrow
I will look it up in the dictionary
I will never force you to marry him
I will side with you just this once
I will stay here for a short period
I wish he had gone on to university
I wish nothing but the best for you
I wonder if Tom knows what Mary did
I wonder if my efforts will pay off
I would rather walk than go by taxi
It appears to me that you are right
It depends on the size of the chair
It is likely to be cold this winter
It is not easy to solve the problem
It is not good to eat between meals
It is not necessary to bring a gift
It is not polite to point at others
It is not so difficult as you think
It is said that he knows the secret
It is strange that he should say so
It is warm there all the year round
It reminds me of the good old times
It seems that no one knew the truth
It sounds like you had a great time
It took me several hours to draw it
It was stupid of you to believe him
It was the happiest time of my life
It would cost twice as much as that
Jobs are hard to come by these days
Just think what it could do for you
Let me write down the steps for you
Luck comes to those who look for it
Make sure to back up all your files
My boss assigned the hard job to me
My boss praised me for my hard work
My children like to sing in the car
My father asked me to open the door
My mother asked me to set the table
My mother gets up earlier than I do
My uncle has a deep interest in art
My uncle lives in the east of Spain
Newton saw an apple fall off a tree
Night is when most people go to bed
No one can keep me from going there
No one is more determined than I am
No one is sure how many people died
No one knew how much Tom loved Mary
No one knows what has become of her
None of us are opposed to his ideas
One of my wisdom teeth is coming in
Our car broke down on our way there
Perhaps Tom can help you find a job
Please come to my house for a while
Please tell me where to park my car
Rice is the chief crop in this area
She applied her mind to her new job
She asked me to come to her bedside
She asked me what had become of him
She came back just as I was leaving
She can swim as fast as her brother
She cooks things for me that I like
She gave an oral report to her boss
She has a large room all to herself
She is happiest when she is at home
She is used to staying up all night
She kept me waiting for a long time
She laughed at the sight of his hat
She lived all her life in that town
She looked well when I last saw her
She managed to learn to drive a car
She put lots of sugar in the coffee
She put up with the pain quite well
She wants to keep him at a distance
She was brought up in a rich family
She was the first one to notice him
Sitting down all day is bad for you
That bus stops in front of my house
That job is impossible for me to do
That was the hardest job of my life
That would be a waste of her talent
That would be a waste of his talent
The Bakers have a farm up the river
The answer was right in front of me
The doctor will be here in a minute
The door opened and a man walked in
The doorman will call a taxi for us
The game will be held rain or shine
The garden is in front of the house
The holidays came to an end at last
The ice was thick enough to walk on
The kid has a keen sense of hearing
The man robbed him of all his money
The mirror is on top of the dresser
The noise is going to wake the baby
The old couple gave him up for lost
The plane will take off in one hour
The rule does not apply in our case
The table in that room is very nice
The value of the dollar is going up
The village I live in is very small
The war on drugs is a political war
The way she talks gets on my nerves
The woman gave birth to a baby girl
The young man lives in an old house
There are no more bullets in my gun
There is a bus stop near our school
There is a small pond in our garden
There used to be an old temple here
There was a lot of snow last winter
There was a strong wind on that day
They got the short end of the stick
They set up a new company in London
Things are not like they used to be
This book will be very useful to us
This dress is much too large for me
This gives me the strength to go on
This highway saves us a lot of time
This is a very important day for us
This is the house where he was born
This pen is very easy to write with
This train is made up of seven cars
This watch was given me by my uncle
Tom and I are both waiting for Mary
Tom asked Mary to wait for him here
Tom asked me how many guitars I own
Tom goes to school five days a week
Tom had a heart tattooed on his arm
Tom handed Mary a cup of hot coffee
Tom has decided to take the day off
Tom has lived in Chicago for a year
Tom is going to be thirty next year
Tom is really busy most of the time
Tom is the tallest one in the class
Tom is trying not to worry too much
Tom is used to staying up all night
Tom knows a lot of stuff about Mary
Tom lived in Boston for a long time
Tom made room for Mary on the bench
Tom may never be able to walk again
Tom never seems to know what to say
Tom pulled a box from under the bed
Tom said that you tried to kill him
Tom showed us a photo of his mother
Tom takes very good care of his car
Tom threw an empty beer can at Mary
Tom told Mary not to swim with John
Tom told me which book I should buy
Tom took a book down from the shelf
Tom waited for Mary for a long time
Tom walked to the front of the room
Tom wants to come to Boston with us
Tom wants to come with us to Boston
Try to be more punctual from now on
Try to make it last a little longer
We found out that he was her father
We happened to be on the same train
We have a stressful day ahead of us
We invite you to listen to us again
We might as well get this over with
We spent the night in a cheap hotel
We talked to each other for a while
We were obliged to give up our plan
We were on the same train by chance
We will keep the peace at all costs
You can eat lunch here in this room
You have too many irons in the fire
You need a keycard to open the door
You need to be here for your family
You should not give him up for lost
You will soon cease to think of her
You will wish you had never seen it
A dollar is equal to a hundred cents
A fire broke out on the second floor
A forest fire broke out in this area
A year has passed since he came here
All I want for Christmas is a guitar
All you have to do is to concentrate
Allow me to introduce my wife to you
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
At times I feel like quitting my job
Better to err on the side of caution
Bring as many boxes as you can carry
Classical music is not my cup of tea
Have your paper on my desk by Monday
He accused her of having lied to him
He attends the same school that I do
He called out the name of the winner
He can speak Thai as well as English
He compared his car to the new model
He crossed the river in a small boat
He does not have anyone to play with
He excelled in music even as a child
He fell in love with a younger woman
He fell in love with his best friend
He felt in his pocket for his wallet
He gave his blood to help his sister
He goes to the library to read books
He had an accident and broke his leg
He has good reason to get very angry
He headed for the door at full speed
He invested a lot of money in stocks
He is absorbed in the study of Latin
He is bigger than all the other boys
He is leaving for New York next week
He is proud of his father being rich
He is saving money for a trip abroad
He is used to that type of situation
He is younger than me by three years
He keeps all his savings in the bank
He listened with his ear to the door
He lives as if he were a millionaire
He lives in the western part of town
He made the company what it is today
He missed the last train by a minute
He passed his property on to his son
He played a key role in the movement
He put a hand gently on her shoulder
He ran at the sight of the policeman
He returned home by way of Hong Kong
He said he had been to Hawaii before
He said that he would call you later
He says that he enjoyed it very much
He says that he wants to settle down
He shrank back in the face of danger
He slammed the door right in my face
He stood face to face with his enemy
He threw away a bunch of old letters
He took a quick look at the magazine
He took his wallet out of his pocket
He took out a dollar from his wallet
He walked back and forth in the room
He was absent from school for a week
He was driving the car at full speed
He was my best friend in high school
He was wise not to participate in it
He went from Tokyo to Osaka by plane
He worked hard to save up some money
Heavy rains fell for more than a day
Her fiancé gave her a very big ring
Her name is known all over the world
Her passing the exam is a sure thing
I agree with you to a certain extent
I agreed to split the money with Tom
I already know what I wanted to know
I always went to Miami in the summer
I am familiar with this part of town
I am looking for room with twin beds
I am sure that you will be satisfied
I am the first musician in my family
I bought the same camera as you have
I chanced to meet him at the airport
I consider her to be an honest woman
I could make nothing of what he said
I could swim faster when I was young
I could use some help in the kitchen
I decided to come to Japan last year
I did everything I could to stop Tom
I did not take anything from his bag
I drank a glass of milk this morning
I expect that Tom will pass the exam
I explicitly told Tom not to do that
I fell sound asleep before I knew it
I felt my phone vibrate in my pocket
I forgot to tell you my phone number
I found it easy to find the building
I found it easy to solve the problem
I found it necessary to ask for help
I found out how to solve the problem
I get only five days off this summer
I go to the dentist every second day
I had a checkup the week before last
I had a fantastic time at your party
I had a really great time last night
I had met her many times before then
I had met him many times before then
I had my watch repaired at the store
I had no idea you could speak French
I had no notion that you were coming
I had to decide right then and there
I hate being alone this time of year
I hate the way the water tastes here
I have a friend who can speak French
I have a friend who lives in England
I have a friend who lives in Sapporo
I have a large family to provide for
I have an urgent matter to attend to
I have been in Japan for three years
I have had quite enough of his jokes
I have lunch at noon with my friends
I have no more than one thousand yen
I have nothing more to say about him
I have nothing to do with that crime
I have nothing to do with the affair
I have nothing to say in this regard
I have some numbness in my left hand
I have some problems to take care of
I have some things in the hotel safe
I have to make sure everything is OK
I have to part with my old furniture
I hope the bus will come before long
I just got back from my morning swim
I just want to finish this and leave
I kind of expected you to come alone
I know better than to lend him money
I know that I should be sleeping now
I know that this is important to you
I know that you still think about me
I left my tennis racket on the train
I lied to my girlfriend about my age
I like to read before going to sleep
I looked at the calendar on the wall
I made myself a cup of hot chocolate
I made sure that no one was watching
I managed to repair my car by myself
I met her at the station by accident
I need to know your answer by Friday
I never thought it would be this bad
I never want to feel like this again
I never wanted any of this to happen
I only wish I could return the favor
I opened an account at a nearby bank
I planted an apple tree in my garden
I prefer to go barefoot in the house
I read at least one book every month
I really have to get this done today
I really love her older sister a lot
I really want Tom to stop doing that
I remember when I was about your age
I respect you for what you have done
I spent all my money on stupid stuff
I spoke to my uncle on the telephone
I stuck with it until I was finished
I suppose you have the right to know
I think Tom may be telling the truth
I think maybe Tom and Mary should go
I think my plan is better than yours
I think she will succeed as a lawyer
I think that my German is really bad
I think we still have plenty of time
I think what Tom did was very stupid
I think what Tom is doing is amazing
I thought that would be a great idea
I thought we could stay here all day
I thought you had it all figured out
I tried to learn the melody by heart
I used to fish for hours on holidays
I used to play tennis in high school
I want a person who can speak French
I want to buy a more expensive watch
I want to share my thoughts with you
I want to talk to you about tomorrow
I want to tell you about my problems
I want you to come somewhere with me
I want you to fly to Boston tomorrow
I want you to get started right away
I was able to accomplish a lot today
I was never so humiliated in my life
I was scared that you might leave me
I was the worst student in the class
I was wondering if you could help me
I went to Europe by way of Anchorage
I went to the movies with my brother
I will come to your country some day
I will wait here until he comes back
I wish you could be a little quieter
I wonder if what I wrote was correct
I would rather stay home than go out
It all started on a hot summer night
It happened that I was in Paris then
It is amazing that you won the prize
It is better to give than to receive
It is certain that he will come here
It is not going to rain this evening
It looks like winter is here to stay
It really annoys me when you do that
It seemed that he was short of money
It seems that no one knows the truth
It takes time to heal from a divorce
It took me several hours to write it
It took me some time to persuade her
It turned out that he was her father
It was broad daylight when I woke up
It was like something out of a movie
It was made to look like an accident
It was so cold that he was shivering
It was the perfect moment for a kiss
Keep your dog chained up to the tree
Keep your hands where I can see them
Let me explain to you how this works
Let me know when you get the package
Make a wish and blow out the candles
My doctor told me to give up smoking
My father is to appear on TV tonight
My father makes good use of his time
My grandma injured her leg in a fall
My house is on the outskirts of town
My house was robbed while I was away
My mom likes my brother more than me
My mother is making my father a cake
No one seems to listen to us anymore
None of us plan to go swimming today
On his shirt there was a sauce stain
One of the apples fell to the ground
Please say hello to your wife for me
Please write to me from time to time
Roll up your sleeves and get to work
She advised him to come back at once
She appears to have a lot of friends
She argued with him and then hit him
She asked him not to leave her alone
She asked him to come into her house
She asked him to give her some money
She bought a new house the other day
She died on a cold night in December
She fell down and broke her left leg
She had a good time talking with him
She has this big room all to herself
She kept me waiting for over an hour
She laid her head down on the pillow
She loves Tom more than she loves me
She needs him more than he needs her
She offered her seat to an old woman
She ordered him to clean up his room
She picked up one of the glass vases
She taught him how to play the piano
She turned to the left at the corner
She used to pray before going to bed
She was almost knocked down by a car
She was obliged to marry the old man
She was too tired to keep on working
She was watching TV when I came home
She will give you what money she has
She wore a red scarf around her neck
She writes to her son every so often
Show me what you have in your pocket
Stop stalling and do what I told you
Thanks for showing me how to do that
That cloud looks like a rabbit to me
That was a pretty stupid thing to do
That was just the tip of the iceberg
The bus will be here in five minutes
The car is old but in good condition
The ceiling is very low in this room
The dictionary is of great use to me
The dishes are piling up in the sink
The doctor ordered me to stay in bed
The dog is called Spot by the family
The man aimed a gun at the policeman
The man was hiding in a dense forest
The new tax law is full of loopholes
The old woman got hurt when she fell
The police told me not to leave town
The problem is that we have no money
The red hat goes well with her dress
The roof is really in need of repair
The roses are in bloom in our garden
The royal palace was built on a hill
The same is true of all human beings
The shell of an egg is easily broken
The soldier aimed his gun at the man
The trouble is that we have no money
There are a lot of people here today
There are twenty four hours in a day
There has been no rain for two weeks
There is a big hole in your stocking
There is enough bread for all of you
There used to be a hotel around here
There was a mad rush toward the exit
There was no money left in my wallet
They had to read the book many times
They just want an excuse to fire you
They live in a city close to Beijing
This bus will take you to the museum
This is a lot more fun than studying
This is a portrait of my late father
This is something I need to do alone
This is the best camera in the store
This is the boy who found your watch
This is the key that opens that door
This is the office in which he works
This is the place where Tom was born
This is the village where I was born
This tree is more than a century old
Those were the best years of my life
Those who know him speak well of him
Tom advised Mary to go to the police
Tom and Mary make a very nice couple
Tom and Mary used to be good friends
Tom and Mary work in the same office
Tom asked Mary to pass him the gravy
Tom asked Mary why she had done that
Tom asked me if I liked Chinese food
Tom ate what little food he had left
Tom banged his head on a tree branch
Tom decided not to go to the meeting
Tom had a good reason for being late
Tom has a daughter who is a musician
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston
Tom is lying on the sofa watching TV
Tom is the most boring person I know
Tom is the newest member of our team
Tom knew that Mary had done her best
Tom learned to dive when he was five
Tom pretended not to know what to do
Tom pushed back his chair and got up
Tom refused to take part in the game
Tom screamed at the top of his lungs
Tom told me a good joke this morning
Tom told me he checked the oil level
Tom was very happy when his team won
Turn right at the end of that street
We are faced with a host of problems
We are subject to the laws of nature
We have a small table in the kitchen
We must achieve our aim at any price
We must do away with these old rules
We should save money for a rainy day
We sought to come to terms with them
We went to the park to take pictures
We went up the mountain by cable car
We were able to catch the last train
We were just about to enter the room
We will become happy in the long run
We will get to Tokyo Station at noon
What she said turned out to be false
You can borrow three books at a time
You can have a ride on my motorcycle
You can pour the wine into the glass
You can spend the night at our place
You can swim much better than he can
You have a tendency to talk too fast
You have caused me to lose my temper
You have no right to oppose our plan
You have too many books on the shelf
You may call on me whenever you like
You must be more careful from now on
You must get off at the next station
You ought to know better at your age
You said you were going to handle it
You should go and have your hair cut
You should have told it to me sooner
You should start as early as you can
You will soon come to like this town
A big bridge was built over the river
A dish can be spicy without being hot
A gang of thieves broke into the bank
A hammer was used to break the window
A is the first letter of the alphabet
A plastic dish will melt on the stove
A smart dog never barks for no reason
Ask him if he will attend the meeting
Be careful near the edge of the cliff
Brush your teeth at least twice a day
Come and see me whenever you are free
Give me something I can cut this with
He added a little sugar to the coffee
He always wants to have the last word
He became brave in the face of danger
He came back at about nine last night
He claimed to be an expert in finance
He earns more money than he can spend
He fainted in the midst of his speech
He felt in his pocket for his lighter
He forgot to come to see me yesterday
He gave away all his money to charity
He gets a haircut three times a month
He got the first prize in the contest
He had a queer expression on his face
He had his arm broken during the game
He had his pocket picked in the crowd
He has a big restaurant near the lake
He has a good record as a businessman
He has a large basket full of flowers
He has been secretly in love with her
He has to have an operation next week
He is a critic rather than a novelist
He is a professor of English at Leeds
He is holding his books under his arm
He is the fastest runner in our class
He is working in the field of biology
He left everything to her in his will
He lost a fortune in the stock market
He never pays attention to what I say
He owes his success only to good luck
He ran away when he saw the policeman
He ran the risk of having an accident
He stayed at my place for three weeks
He stayed in New York for three weeks
He studies ten hours a day on average
He tried in vain to solve the problem
He turned pale the instant he saw her
He usually fed his dog cheap dog food
He wanted the cab driver to turn left
He was angry because of what she said
He was given the benefit of the doubt
He was listening to music in his room
He was too proud to accept any reward
He will arrive by eight at the latest
He writes to his parents once a month
Her reputation was hurt a lot by this
Her words were like those of an angel
I advise you to listen to your doctor
I always got up early in my childhood
I am glad that you have returned safe
I am going to write a letter tomorrow
I am sure of winning the tennis match
I arrived too late to hear his speech
I asked my mother what to bring there
I can no longer find the Vivendi file
I come from a small town in Australia
I could feel the sand between my toes
I could not help but state my opinion
I cut the article out of the magazine
I did everything I was supposed to do
I feel guilty about having told a lie
I feel like taking a day off tomorrow
I felt the sweat trickle down my brow
I find the sound of the rain relaxing
I forgot to bring an umbrella with me
I found it difficult to read the book
I give you plenty of money each month
I go to Hiroshima three times a month
I got the news from a reliable source
I guess you will be very busy tonight
I had dinner with a friend last night
I had nothing to do with that problem
I had nothing to do with the accident
I have a clear memory of my childhood
I have an interest in cello and piano
I have less and less time for reading
I have mosquito bites all over my arm
I have never seen her help her father
I have not been studying for two days
I have nothing to do with this matter
I have read every book in the library
I have simply nothing to say about it
I have to change into my work clothes
I have to get up quite early tomorrow
I have to remember to mail the letter
I have to tell her the truth tomorrow
I heard a dog barking in the distance
I hope I can count on your discretion
I just thought you might want to talk
I just wanted to listen to some music
I know Tom really does care about you
I know you were in Boston last summer
I like spring the best of the seasons
I may have told you this story before
I met her by accident on Third Avenue
I must discuss that new plan with him
I need some medicine to kill the pain
I need the key to decode this message
I never had the opportunity to use it
I never thought it could happen to me
I never thought it would happen to me
I prefer going out to staying at home
I ran into your mother in the library
I read the book from beginning to end
I really hope things work out for you
I really liked what you cooked for me
I recognized her the moment I saw her
I saw Tom yesterday and he looked sad
I saw a spider walking on the ceiling
I sleep with two quilts in the winter
I spent the whole day reading a novel
I stayed at home instead of going out
I stepped aside so that he could pass
I still think this is the best choice
I think my girlfriend is kind of cute
I think that you are twenty years old
I think we ought to change our policy
I think we should talk about this now
I think what Tom is doing is terrific
I think you should stay where you are
I thought I might never see you again
I thought I was doing the right thing
I thought Tom and Mary were both dead
I thought it sounded like a good idea
I thought it was illegal to park here
I thought we were going out to dinner
I thought you had learned that by now
I thought you might feel the same way
I thought you were going to stay home
I thought you were having a good time
I thought you were trying to be funny
I used to play the guitar fairly well
I want a better look at this document
I want something to read on the train
I want this fixed as soon as possible
I want to apologize for the other day
I want to ask you one simple question
I want to devote my life to education
I want to help you with your homework
I want to make amends for my behavior
I wanted to do something nice for you
I wanted to watch that movie with you
I was forced to drink against my will
I was the one who built this doghouse
I went out even though it was raining
I will be expecting a letter from her
I will have finished the work by noon
I will speak to her about it directly
I will stay home if it rains tomorrow
I wish we could ask Tom that question
I wonder if he enjoyed the last match
I wonder if it will clear up tomorrow
I would give anything to win her back
I would like to be an English teacher
I would like to go to Russia sometime
It depends on how much money you have
It has been many years since she died
It is high time you spilled the beans
It is necessary that you see a doctor
It is not clear who wrote this letter
It was a mess in the department store
It was a very good experience for him
It was nice and warm inside the house
It was the proudest moment of my life
It would be better to stay home today
Look at the map on the wall carefully
Man is the only animal that can laugh
Man is the only animal that can speak
Marriage is the last thing on my mind
Mary asked Tom to shave off his beard
Mary took the cookies out of the oven
Mary wants both a career and a family
Mary was looking for you at that time
Mother was very busy most of the time
My daughter is to get married in June
My father has been dead for ten years
My friend said she bought a new watch
My legs are getting better day by day
My mother has gone to the beauty shop
My mother said that she was all right
My parents died when I was very young
My sister has her hair done each week
My uncle calls on me every three days
My uncle died of cancer two years ago
My uncle is staying with us this week
Not everybody was as lucky as we were
Our hens laid a lot of eggs yesterday
Pick out the shirt that you like best
Please hand this in at the front desk
Please show me the way to the station
Please tell me what I should do first
Please tell me what you know about it
She accused him of having lied to her
She advised him not to drink too much
She advised him not to drive too fast
She advised him on what books to read
She advised him to go to the hospital
She baked bread and cakes in the oven
She brags about how well she can cook
She called up her mother on the phone
She did nothing but cry all the while
She eats lunch here from time to time
She explained to him why she was late
She gets up the earliest in my family
She goes to the bookstore once a week
She had a headache from lack of sleep
She has a special way of making bread
She helped the old man cross the road
She hurt her elbow when she fell down
She introduced me to him at the party
She is not rich enough to waste money
She lives a few blocks away from here
She lost her temper and shouted at me
She may realize later on what I meant
She often goes to the movies with him
She sat next him with her eyes closed
She smiled at the sight of her mother
She spends as much money as she earns
She stood up and walked to the window
She told him that her father had died
She took the book back to the library
She turned her old dress into a skirt
She walked arm in arm with her father
She was a bundle of nerves last night
She was advised by him on that matter
She was advised by him to be punctual
She was advised by him to lose weight
She was advised by him to work harder
She was not interested in boys at all
She went to the mall with her friends
Some parts of this city are very ugly
Sooner or later his luck will run out
Tell her that I am treating a patient
Tell me again how much money you have
Tell me what I should be watching for
Tell me what you did on your holidays
The answer was staring me in the face
The baby in the cradle is very pretty
The boy carved his name into the tree
The boy standing over there is my son
The boys in the village laughed at me
The boys were as nervous as the girls
The button on your coat is coming off
The dress in the window caught my eye
The earth is far bigger than the moon
The elevator seems to be out of order
The family seemed to be under a curse
The firm has its head office in Osaka
The girl was afraid of her own shadow
The house with the green roof is mine
The ice melted into a puddle of water
The life span of a butterfly is short
The main idea in his speech was unity
The mere sight of a dog frightens him
The new boss runs a really tight ship
The next station is where you get off
The old man tripped over his own feet
The pain was more than he could stand
The plane was late due to bad weather
The police set out to solve the crime
The poor child was born deaf and dumb
The price of this camera is very high
The prize will go to the best student
The problem is how to raise the funds
The ring was not to be found anywhere
The robber aimed his gun at the clerk
The shop was closed when I went there
The streets of New York are very wide
The tall man looked at Tom and smiled
The thief stubbed his toe on the door
The town has changed a lot since then
The town was defended by a large army
The trip will take at least five days
The trouble is that it costs too much
The value of the dollar began to drop
The water in this river is very clean
There are lots of animals in the park
There are no new messages in my inbox
There are too many people in the park
There is a traffic jam on the highway
There is an urgent need for new ideas
There was almost no color in his face
There was nothing I could do about it
There were a few children in the room
There were a lot of murders last year
They concluded that he had told a lie
They have to live on his small income
They lived on farms or in small towns
They looked up to him as their leader
They met for the first time in London
They went into the woods for a picnic
They went to the zoo by bus yesterday
This bus will take you to the station
This hut is in danger of falling down
This is a doghouse that I made myself
This is the best restaurant I know of
This is the key that opened that door
This is the lady I spoke of yesterday
This is the village where he was born
This place gives me a really bad vibe
Tom and I went there on our honeymoon
Tom and Mary are playing a video game
Tom and Mary went on a shopping spree
Tom asked Mary to lend him some money
Tom could do nothing but sit and wait
Tom gave Mary the first piece of cake
Tom happens to be very good at French
Tom has a large closet in his bedroom
Tom has already spoken to me about it
Tom has lost a lot of weight recently
Tom is going to do something about it
Tom is just trying to make ends meets
Tom is the captain of the soccer team
Tom is the fastest runner on our team
Tom kept Mary waiting for a long time
Tom kissed Mary and then went to work
Tom knew what Mary was supposed to do
Tom knows he has no chance of winning
Tom may not come to our party tonight
Tom often comes to see me on weekends
Tom said that he feels like going out
Tom says he will never go there again
Tom was the one who took this picture
Tom was thinking of going to New York
Tom washed the apple before he ate it
Tom went on a business trip last week
We almost got them where we want them
We ate cotton candy at the state fair
We can see the island in the distance
We could see the ship in the distance
We ended up not getting there on time
We finally have you where we want you
We got a little bored with each other
We have a lot of earthquakes in Japan
We have ample time to catch our train
We have never heard him sing the song
We have no reason to change our plans
We have two unused rooms in our house
We need to be a little more efficient
We pitched the tent next to the river
We ran into each other at the airport
We ran into each other at the station
We saw the sun sink below the horizon
We think too much and feel too little
We thought his threat was only a joke
We want to protect this world we have
We were in danger of losing our lives
We were not to blame for the accident
We were tired out after our long walk
We will begin the party when he comes
You have no one but yourself to blame
You have no one to blame but yourself
You have to begin as soon as possible
You may pay in advance for your order
You need to stop doing that right now
You ought to have told me that before
You should be out of here by tomorrow
You should have a doctor look at that
You should make good use of your time
You will soon be convinced I am right
Your daughter is not a child any more
Your death will not have been in vain
Your mother has made you what you are
A Japanese would never do such a thing
A day without laughter is a day wasted
A dry spell accounts for the poor crop
A general election will be held in May
A new kind of bullet had been invented
A wounded whale washed up on the beach
A young girl was at the steering wheel
All my friends turned their back on me
All of my relatives are taller than me
All the doors of the house were closed
All the people who were here have left
Always look on the bright side of life
An American spoke to me at the station
Astronomy is by no means a new science
Both he and I are high school students
Boxers have to weigh in before a fight
Come early so we can discuss the plans
December is the last month of the year
Divide the cake among the three of you
Eating too much is bad for your health
Few people live to be ninety years old
Give my regards to your aunt and uncle
Good lumber is hard to find these days
Guess what I ate for dinner last night
He became ever more famous as a critic
He can only pay twenty dollars at most
He carved a Buddhist image out of wood
He caused his parents a lot of anxiety
He comes from a small but wealthy town
He could not sleep because of the heat
He examined the spare parts one by one
He fainted in the middle of his speech
He felt sad because he lost his father
He forgot that he bought her a present
He gave the barking dog a vicious kick
He gets a kick out of reckless driving
He got lost while walking in the woods
He has promised never to be late again
He has something to do with the matter
He is a member of the parish committee
He is ashamed of his father being poor
He is generally at home in the evening
He is neither for nor against the plan
He is richer than anybody else in town
He is the head of the sales department
He is the spitting image of his father
He left the room without saying a word
He lost his life in a traffic accident
He needs to be the center of attention
He often takes his children to the zoo
He promised not to tell that to anyone
He put his hand gently on her shoulder
He responded to her offer with a laugh
He saw there what he had dreamed about
He seems to be involved in that matter
He showed me a lot of beautiful photos
He suggested that we take a short rest
He took pictures of me with his camera
He turned off all the lights at eleven
He turned over the business to his son
He turned pale when he heard that news
He urged his government not to sign it
He used to tell me stories about India
He was advanced to the rank of general
He was never to see his homeland again
He was surprised at the sight of blood
He was terribly poor when he was young
He will provide you with what you need
He will soon be past playing with toys
He worked as a diplomat for many years
Her blue shoes go well with that dress
Her friends waited for her by the gate
Her new novel has become a best seller
Her stern look got him to quit talking
His brother is more patient than he is
His essay was concise and to the point
His name is known all over the country
How many of them survived is not known
I almost left my umbrella in the train
I almost stepped on a skunk last night
I always arrive a little ahead of time
I am going to see the dentist tomorrow
I am grateful to you for your kindness
I appreciate what you are trying to do
I appreciate you trying to cheer me up
I called my mother up from the station
I can give you something for your pain
I can remember the warmth of her hands
I could have done it without your help
I could not sleep because of the noise
I dislike living in such a noisy place
I feel like going to bed early tonight
I felt somebody pat me on the shoulder
I found it easy to answer the question
I found nothing but a pair of scissors
I found the photo you were looking for
I get bored quickly in everything I do
I had no idea this bracelet was stolen
I have a lot of work still outstanding
I have an appointment to dine with him
I have had my hair cut shoulder length
I have never drawn anything in my life
I have something to talk over with you
I have to pay more attention to myself
I have to practice the piano every day
I hope you two are very happy together
I hurried and managed to catch the bus
I just figured out what the problem is
I just wanted to see what would happen
I knew it would happen sooner or later
I knew there would be something to eat
I know more about you than you realize
I know the perfect place for our party
I know the real reason for his absence
I looked up the words in my dictionary
I love the songs sung by Kylie Minogue
I made a deposit in the bank yesterday
I met a man from Boston this afternoon
I more often go to Brussels than Paris
I must visit my friend in the hospital
I never thought it would end like this
I object to being treated like a child
I often played soccer when I was young
I plan to try reading some other books
I really need to talk to you privately
I recall less and less of my childhood
I should get back to writing my report
I slipped and fell on the icy sidewalk
I stayed longer than I thought I would
I stopped so I could smoke a cigarette
I studied for a while in the afternoon
I suggest that you not wait any longer
I suggest we put on some clean clothes
I suppose I could wait a little longer
I suppose you enjoy that sort of thing
I think Tom could be persuaded to help
I think Tom is a little too optimistic
I think that I was followed by someone
I think this medicine will do you good
I think we should wait a little longer
I think you sent me the wrong document
I think you should check under the bed
I thought Tom died last year in Boston
I thought you had more sense than that
I thought you had somewhere else to be
I thought you might want to come along
I took sides with them in the argument
I took the elevator to the third floor
I translated the poem the best I could
I try to travel with only one suitcase
I used to dream about becoming a model
I used to work in an electronics store
I usually take a shower in the evening
I usually went to the movies on Sunday
I want a jump rope with wooden handles
I want to be worthy of your friendship
I want to do some shopping around here
I want to introduce you to some people
I want to know more about your country
I want to make a good first impression
I want to send this by registered mail
I want very much for you to understand
I was able to answer all the questions
I was at home almost all day yesterday
I was born and brought up in Matsuyama
I was embarrassed when he talked to me
I was hoping we could still be friends
I was kept waiting nearly half an hour
I was up all night writing this report
I watched TV after I washed the dishes
I will lend you whatever book you need
I will send it by email this afternoon
I wish I had listened to your warnings
I wish that I could give you something
I wish there were more people like you
I wonder what I should make for dinner
I would like to visit New York someday
I would like to work with your company
I would rather stay here than go there
It appeared that he meant what he said
It may have rained a little last night
It seems to me that something is wrong
It took me two hours to reach Yokohama
It was his silence that made her angry
It was impossible to pull out the cork
It was not clear what she really meant
It was summer and the weather was warm
It would be nice if it stopped raining
Just do everything Tom tells you to do
Let me introduce you to a good dentist
Let me put this in perspective for you
Look at her putting on airs over there
Looks like we barked up the wrong tree
Make sure that the dog does not escape
Mary decided never to see him any more
Mary was given a raise by her employer
Mary went on a voyage around the world
Most experts think a lot of his theory
My baby brother sleeps ten hours a day
My big brother shared his cake with me
My brother will often sit up all night
My credit card was rejected by the ATM
My daughter will come of age next year
My dog has been missing for three days
My father does not always walk to work
My father is a good speaker of English
My father is not always free on Sunday
My father will soon be forty years old
My mother baked a cake for my birthday
My mother gets up early in the morning
My mother is knitting me a new sweater
My mother prepared me for the bad news
My muscles were aching and I was tired
My parents forbade me to see Tom again
My sister is not a high school student
My sister is suffering from a bad cold
My sister often takes care of the baby
My success is largely due to your help
My younger brother is taller than I am
Never do anything just to show you can
No one doubts her fitness for the post
No one was supposed to know about that
Nobody knows why he turns down my help
One of the bulls pushed the fence down
One of the children left the door open
Only a handful of people know the fact
Paper napkins are sold in packs of ten
Presently the plan is still in the air
Raise your hand if you have a question
Raise your hand if you know the answer
Seven is believed to be a lucky number
She advised him on how to stay healthy
She advised him to cut down on smoking
She advised him to take a long holiday
She always urges him to try new things
She asked them to take their shoes off
She burst out laughing when she saw me
She called him every bad name she knew
She gave him a sweater on his birthday
She had a choice of going or remaining
She had never been so proud of herself
She has nothing to do with that affair
She is a difficult person to deal with
She is a student who studies very hard
She is completely deaf in her left ear
She is living in the middle of nowhere
She is old enough to travel by herself
She knew better than to argue with him
She reminds me very much of her mother
She said that she saw a suspicious man
She sometimes takes a walk in the park
She talked him into buying a new house
She taught him the tricks of the trade
She told him where to put the suitcase
She used to help him with his homework
She wants to know who sent the flowers
She was a Smith before she got married
She was advised by him to stop smoking
She was playing the piano at that time
She was scared to death of her husband
She worked hard in order to save money
Solar energy is a new source of energy
Some believe in UFOs and others do not
Tell them to call me before they leave
Thank you for inviting me to the party
That actually sounds like a lot of fun
That child wants a friend to play with
That is the fastest train in the world
That place is in the middle of nowhere
That should only take me a few minutes
That song reminds me of a certain girl
That would be a waste of their talents
The Golden Gate Bridge is made of iron
The best player of all times was Pelé
The boy was searching for the lost key
The building that I saw was very large
The changes are being made as we speak
The cool air felt wonderful on my face
The cost of gasoline keeps on going up
The country is in a bad economic state
The crew were all waiting for the news
The deal fell apart at the last minute
The doctor arrived in the nick of time
The dog answers to the name of Blackie
The door is locked at nine every night
The earth is much larger than the moon
The enemy kept up their attack all day
The event is still fresh in our memory
The first season of the year is spring
The fugitive made a run for the border
The huge tanker has just left the dock
The leaves on the tree have turned red
The man lit a cigarette with a lighter
The man was ashamed of being born poor
The man you saw yesterday was my uncle
The missing cat has not been found yet
The next step was to sign the document
The only thing I have now are memories
The policeman aimed his gun at the man
The rich are different from you and me
The town where I was born is beautiful
The traveler stopped to ask me the way
The two towns are separated by a river
The war was finally brought to a close
The whole class is present once a week
The young man came running to meet her
There are no dogs bigger than this one
There are still many things left to do
There are two cats sleeping on the bed
There is a bird feeder in our backyard
There is an urgent need for more money
There is no doubt that he was murdered
There is not much traffic on this road
There must be something else we can do
There was a castle here many years ago
There was a tape recorder on the table
There was little sugar left in the pot
These are my shoes and those are yours
They are both working at the pet store
They are on good terms with each other
They arrived in Paris at the same time
They called for an end to the fighting
They knew how much danger they were in
They love to give parties all the time
They shot the film in an actual desert
They spent the entire day on the beach
They were waiting for the gate to open
This dog is trained to smell out drugs
This is a matter of the utmost gravity
This is the biggest hotel in this city
This is the dictionary I use every day
This is the reason I disagree with you
This letter was never meant to be sent
This steak is as tough as shoe leather
Those kinds of methods are out of date
Those old laws were all done away with
Tom and Mary both shook their heads no
Tom and his friends went to the circus
Tom asked Mary to play tennis with him
Tom asked Mary who she was looking for
Tom asked Mary why John was so unhappy
Tom blew all his money on a motorcycle
Tom challenged Mary to a game of chess
Tom claimed to be an expert in finance
Tom did it with the best of intentions
Tom dried his hands with a small towel
Tom fainted at the sight of the needle
Tom got a call from someone named Mary
Tom grew up in a small fishing village
Tom has to stay in Boston this weekend
Tom is a close personal friend of mine
Tom is a security guard at the airport
Tom is very good at playing the violin
Tom looked at the painting on the wall
Tom made an emergency stop on the road
Tom showed up at just the right moment
Tom started to like Mary more and more
Tom threw something at me and I ducked
We always have a party on his birthday
We have a simple solution for all this
We have enough time to catch the train
We must cut our expenses to save money
We need to be more realistic than that
We need to get it done before tomorrow
We saw the parade move down the street
We used a barrel for a makeshift table
We went out for a walk after breakfast
We were excited as we watched the game
We were very impressed by his new book
We will make an exception of your case
What we should do next is the question
Women seem to like him for some reason
You can always depend upon her to help
You can use a dictionary for this exam
You had better give up smoking at once
You made the same mistake as last time
You may bring your own lunch to school
You may choose either of the two books
You need to be more attentive in class
You should buy her a gift card instead
You should not be afraid of the future
You will find this in a hardware store
Your dream may come true at any moment
Your question is hard for me to answer
You’d better lie low for a few weeks
A bunch of people died in the explosion
A doctor should never let a patient die
A drunken man was sleeping on the bench
A field of grass can be quite beautiful
A lot of books are published every year
A number of tickets are sold in advance
A storm kept the ship from leaving Kobe
All he is thinking about is meeting her
All of a sudden the sky became overcast
All our children go to school in Boston
Be at the train station at eleven sharp
But his name is slightly familiar to me
Children begin school at the age of six
Combine all the parts to make one piece
Dinosaurs died out a very long time ago
Dissolve the tablet in a glass of water
Do not throw anything out of the window
Do stop talking and listen to the music
Doctors take an oath not to harm anyone
Each member has to pay a membership fee
Eating fast food is bad for your health
English is spoken in a lot of countries
English is taught in a lot of countries
Give me a couple minutes to get dressed
He arrived at the station out of breath
He asked me who had painted the picture
He ate up the steak and ordered another
He did not intend to hurt your feelings
He drew a straight line with his pencil
He explained in detail what he had seen
He expressed his opinion in a few words
He had bruises all over after the fight
He had his car stolen in broad daylight
He had no particular reason to go there
He had the courage to decline the offer
He has a good chance of getting elected
He has been living here these ten years
He has done many things for poor people
He has gone to Osaka on urgent business
He has never been scolded by his father
He has since taken to drinking at lunch
He has the habit of scratching his head
He is always on time for an appointment
He is fortunate having such a good wife
He is inclined to argue at great length
He is now in a very difficult situation
He is what we call a walking dictionary
He looked up the word in his dictionary
He lost his son in the traffic accident
He possessed a large house and two cars
He read the article over and over again
He remembers to write to her every week
He retired to his own room after supper
He ripped up all her letters and photos
He sacrificed his own life to save them
He sent a letter addressed to his uncle
He served in the House for twelve years
He still says that he did nothing wrong
He stretched out his arm for a magazine
He traveled with only a dog for company
He turned his back on the old tradition
He waited for the elevator to come down
He wanted to be a great military leader
He was a member of the Republican Party
He was destined never to meet her again
He was easily able to solve the problem
He was not conscious of his own mistake
He was sentenced to three years in jail
He was the only witness of the accident
He will walk in the park this afternoon
He wrote a novel based on ancient myths
Her shyness makes me like her even more
Her success as a singer made her famous
His speech made a good impression on me
His success was mostly due to good luck
His wife goes with him wherever he goes
I already told you that a hundred times
I am far from satisfied with the result
I am thinking of going abroad next year
I am thinking of going to the mountains
I arrived too late and missed the train
I assure you Tom will be perfectly safe
I became aware of someone looking at me
I believe what is written in her letter
I could hear her sobbing in her bedroom
I could not come to your birthday party
I could smell the alcohol on his breath
I dreamed I had been abducted by aliens
I dreamed that I was buying this guitar
I enjoyed talking with him at the party
I feel worse today than I did yesterday
I found it difficult to use the machine
I gave each child three pieces of candy
I guess I just like making people happy
I had a small dinner party last weekend
I had my birthday party at a restaurant
I had never seen a more beautiful sight
I had nothing to do with that situation
I had that weird dream again last night
I had the brakes of my bicycle adjusted
I have been living here for three years
I have never seen such a beautiful girl
I have no words to express my gratitude
I have not more than three thousand yen
I have something in my suitcase for you
I have to buy flowers for my girlfriend
I have to reduce my expenses this month
I hope you behaved well at school today
I just read about that in the newspaper
I just want an affordable place to live
I know you considered me a close friend
I like fruit such as grapes and peaches
I like listening to Tom play the guitar
I like white roses better than red ones
I look forward to hearing from you soon
I nearly fainted when I heard the story
I never expected that she would join us
I never thought it would be so exciting
I often meditate on the meaning of life
I regret missing the chance to meet her
I squeezed the juice out of the oranges
I strongly urge you to follow my advice
I suggested that the meeting be put off
I sure wish I could speak French better
I think Tom wants something to write on
I think we need to postpone the meeting
I think we should talk about this later
I think what Tom is doing is worthwhile
I think you should open an account here
I think your English has improved a lot
I thought Tom had a soccer game tonight
I thought we were going to go somewhere
I thought you said Tom needed more time
I thought you were a decent young woman
I told an amusing story to the children
I told her to quickly finish the report
I took for granted that he got homesick
I took over the business from my father
I tuck my children into bed every night
I want to find someplace quiet to study
I want to get married and have children
I want to make friends with your sister
I want to visit Cuba before Castro dies
I want you to know what really happened
I wanted to talk to you about something
I was afraid of what people would think
I was arrested for aiding in his escape
I was careful to not leave any evidence
I will have left here before you return
I wish we could settle this like adults
I wonder if it really was a coincidence
I wonder why women live longer than men
I would consider Boston a very big city
I would hate to become just a housewife
I would like to marry somebody like her
I would rather go out than stay indoors
I wrote to him for quite another reason
It appears that he will win first prize
It did not last more than three minutes
It hardly ever snows here in the winter
It is necessary for you to stop smoking
It is necessary for you to study harder
It is now necessary to add another rule
It is strange that you should know that
It seems that the store is closed today
It seems that they took the wrong train
It was believed that the earth was flat
It will not be long before spring comes
Life without love has no meaning at all
Mary has been dyeing her hair for years
Mary is the prettiest girl in her class

My father and I played tennis on Sunday
My glasses started to slip down my nose
My grandfather is a bit hard of hearing
My gums bleed whenever I floss my teeth
My mother has been dead these ten years
My parents don’t like the way I dress
My son can already count to one hundred
My wife is always finding fault with me
No one uses that kind of weapon anymore
Nobody can get along with such a person
None of the old trees survived the fire
One mouse is running around in the room
Our car is three years older than yours
Our children all go to the local school
Our destination is still a long way off
Our house was robbed while we were away
Our new teacher is fresh out of college
Please check all the items on this list
Please feel free to ask me any question
Please say hello to your parents for me
Push this button and the door will open
Remind me that the meeting is on Monday
Science begins when you ask why and how

She advised him to stop working so much
She and I usually have the same opinion

She asked me if anything was the matter
She does not have many friends in Kyoto
She found it dull living in the country
She got married at the age of seventeen

She lives with him in a small apartment
She looks happiest when she is with him
She plans to stay at the Oriental Hotel
She said he would be sixteen next month
She spread a beautiful cloth on a table
She threatened to set our house on fire
She tore the letter up after reading it
She wanted to live a more relaxing life
She was on the verge of killing herself
She was surprised that it was that late
She whispered to me that she was hungry
She will be happy when she gets married
Take this medicine when you have a cold
Tell us the story from beginning to end
Texas is nearly twice as large as Japan
Thank you for helping me cross the road
Thank you for helping me reach my goals
That might depend on your point of view
That painting has started to grow on me
That story is too incredible to be true
That was going to be my next suggestion
The Americans did not like the new plan
The DNA test cleared him of all charges
The President spoke to the nation on TV
The apples he sent to me were delicious
The boy has been sleeping for ten hours
The bridge was washed away by the flood
The house that Tom built is really nice
The influence of TV on society is great
The job is not suitable for young girls
The jury found the man guilty of murder
The leaves began to turn red and yellow
The leaves of the trees have turned red
The light is changing from red to green
The old bridge is in danger of collapse
The players on this team are all giants
The point of the pencil has become dull
The road is straight for over ten miles
The seventh day of the week is Saturday
The thief was handed over to the police
The truth finally came out at his trial
The two generals met again the next day
The victim died at a hospital in Boston
The whole world was involved in the war
The work has to be finished before noon
The young couple ate off the same plate
The young man driving the car was drunk
There are a lot of earthquakes in Japan
There are only three girls in the class
There are plenty of oranges on the tree
There is almost no water in this bottle
There is an urgent need for peace talks
There is little wine left in the bottle
There is no reason why he should resign
There is no telling when they will come
There was a food fight in the cafeteria
There were a hundred people in the hall
These are the people who live next door
They did not feel like playing any more
They hoped for even better days to come
They live in that house among the trees
They needed to trade with them for food
They sat around the table to play cards
They were all surprised to see me there
This book is available at one shop only
This hotel is better than the other one
This is the church where we got married
This is the doghouse that I made myself
This is the fastest car in our showroom
This is the hospital where Tom was born
This is the shortest way to the station
This kind of thing happens all the time
This melon will be good to eat tomorrow
This river is very dangerous to swim in
This shop has more candy than that shop
This should be done as soon as possible
This ticket entitles you to a free meal
Those were the saddest hours of my life

We are measuring the depth of the river
We are working in the interest of peace
We could see enemy ships on the horizon
We have a parking lot for the customers
We have no further details at this time
We have nothing to fear but fear itself
We hurried in the direction of the fire
We listened to his lecture on the radio
We must avoid war by all possible means
We need a password to use this computer
We ought to be ready for whatever comes
We saw the film and had dinner together
We seized the town after a short battle
We started a band because we were bored
We still have enough time to discuss it
We were all wondering why you were late
We were worried we might miss the train
Wear warm clothes or you could get sick
What he says sounds very sensible to me
What they wanted was a man like himself
What you are saying does not make sense
Whether he will come at all is doubtful
Workers at the company went on a strike
You are holding my hand in that picture
You are not supposed to smoke at school
You are welcome to do anything you like
You can improve your English if you try
You had better put on your crash helmet
You have a very logical way of thinking
You have as much right as everyone else
You have no idea how distressed she was
You have to judge the case without bias
You must be careful with the wine glass
You need to pay extra for the batteries
You should wash fruit before you eat it
You will have to study harder next year
A boat suddenly appeared out of the mist
A lot of birthday cards will arrive soon
A severe ocean storm hit the West Indies
A teacher must be fair with his students
Absence of rain caused the plants to die
All I wanted was a little more attention
All the flowers in the garden are yellow
All the leaves on the tree turned yellow
Almost no one thinks that we are sisters
Anything you say can be used against you
Anything you say may be used against you
Ask him whether they still live in Tokyo
Better a broken promise than none at all
Check up on the accuracy of this article
Dinner will be served on board the plane

He was known to everybody in the village
He was not conscious of my presence here
He was standing there with a vacant look
He worked hard to provide for his family
Her coat was too casual for the occasion
Her son was killed in a traffic accident
His advice encouraged me to try it again
His face turned pale on hearing the news
His manners are not those of a gentleman
His success was largely due to good luck
Hurry up and bring me something to drink

I often played baseball when I was young
I only eat vegetables that I grow myself
I persuaded him that he should try again

It took me several hours to translate it
It was a pleasure working with you folks
It was like something out of a nightmare
It will not last more than three minutes
Legend has it that this house is haunted
Lend me something with which to cut this

She advised him not to eat between meals
She always clears the table after a meal
She attacked him with a pair of scissors
She can read even this difficult a kanji
She complained of the room being too hot
She demanded to see the person in charge
She despises him only because he is poor
She finished her work an hour in advance
She forgave him for losing all her money
She forgot that she bought him a present
She had to use her dictionary many times
She has the big room entirely to herself
She helped the old man across the street
She is no less beautiful than her mother
She married an American GI after the war
She put on her overcoat before going out
She read the article over and over again
She risked her life to protect her child
She sat next to him and listened quietly
She stayed at the hotel for several days
She talked him into going to the concert
She turned pale when she heard that news
She was absent because she caught a cold
She was shocked when she heard his story
Someone cleaned my room while I was gone
Something is the matter with this TV set
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do
Spring is the best season to visit Kyoto
Take care not to awake the sleeping baby
Take the apple and divide it into halves
Thank you for considering me for the job
Thank you for helping me write my resume
That adds a new dimension to our problem
The ball rolled on the ground towards me
The book you gave me is very interesting
The boy is playing with his toy soldiers
The boy playing the guitar is my brother
The burglar shut the child in the closet
The children go to school in the morning
The church is between my house and yours
The country is headed on the wrong track
The doctor advised me to give up smoking
The dog pursued a rabbit into the forest
The king would not even read the message
The members of the committee are all men

The war brought their research to an end
There are few places to park around here
There are many red flowers in the garden
There are many wild animals in this area
There are people here who need your help
There are plenty of nice girls out there
There is almost no violence in that city
There is an urgent need for blood donors
There is an urgent need for clean energy
There is an urgent need for more doctors
There is little hope that they are alive
There is too much furniture in the house
There is too much furniture in this room
There is very little hope of his success
There were hundreds of birds on the lake
There were no fences on the great plains
There’s no better way to start the day
These empty boxes take up too much space
They admired the fine view from the hill
They arrived at the foot of the mountain
They kept flashing that light in my eyes
They worked together to put out the fire
This is the church where Blake is buried
This is the culmination of years of work

Water turns into steam when it is boiled
We discussed the problem for a long time
We found a secret door into the building
We have more customers than we can count
We have to crack down on illegal trading
We have to get up early tomorrow morning
We live in the country during the summer
We put up the flags on national holidays
We searched the house from top to bottom
We stayed at home because it was raining
We took an examination in math last week
We were all shaking from the bitter cold
We were shown all of their family photos
We wish him well in his future endeavors
You had better ask the doctor for advice
You had better not keep company with him
You have such a wonderful eye for detail
You look a little green around the gills
You need to work on saving your marriage
You should be more careful the next time
You should have helped him with his work
You should play with your cat more often
You should take care of your sick mother
You should try to live within your means

Cancer can be cured if discovered in time
Every family has a skeleton in the closet
Every member but me believes what he says
Every student in the class knows the fact
Finish your homework before you go to bed
He addressed the audience in a soft voice
He always talks as if he knows everything
He boasts that he can speak six languages
He bought a pair of black shoes yesterday
He bought the picture for next to nothing
He committed suicide to atone for his sin
He gave her an engagement ring last night
He had no difficulty in finding the place
He has taken all this trouble for nothing
He helped me to get over the difficulties
He is a doctor and a university professor
He is so honest that everybody trusts him
He left without so much as saying goodbye
He looked at me with a strange expression
He needed capital to start a new business
He said nothing that would make her angry
He thinks of everything in terms of money
He thought the matter over for three days
He took over the business from his father
He was busy getting ready for his journey
He was carrying an umbrella under his arm
He was more surprised than I had expected
He was nearly run over at an intersection
He was playing football with an empty can
He was sentenced to death by firing squad
His boots and pants were covered with mud
His doctor advised him to give up smoking
His house is three times larger than mine
His ideas never earned him a single penny
His ideas never earned him even one penny
His reason for not going is still unclear
Hokkaido is in the northern part of Japan
I am certain that you have noble thoughts
I am expecting some serious work from you
I am working hard trying to learn English
I apologize for not writing to you before
I awoke one morning to find myself famous
I can neither confirm nor deny the rumors
I doubt the new proposal will be accepted
I drank three cups of coffee this morning
I felt like an outcast among those people
I felt tired from having worked for hours
I felt winded after running up the stairs
I found it difficult to solve the problem
I grind my own coffee beans every morning
I have little time for reading these days
I have no hesitation in telling the truth
I have some extra tickets for the concert
I hear that Tom really speaks French well
I heard from someone that she got married
I heard you are planning to switch majors
I hesitate to broach the subject with her
I hope the weather will clear up tomorrow
I just got my textbooks for this semester
I just have one quibble with this product
I just wish I could contribute more money
I like listening to classical music a lot
I like the original better than the remix
I look forward to seeing you at Christmas
I love watching movies that make me think
I made friends with a student from abroad
I need to get something done very quickly
I never claimed that I could speak French
I really do appreciate all your hard work
I really think you should stop doing that
I returned the knife which I had borrowed
I saw the children walk across the street
I stayed home all day long reading novels
I strolled along the streets to kill time
I think I left something in the classroom
I think Tom wants something to write with
I think you might have a drinking problem
I think you ought to postpone the meeting
I think you should think about the future
I thought that book was difficult to read
I understand that a mistake has been made
I want to apologize for everything I said
I want to show you something very special
I was leaving home when Tom telephoned me
I was still eating when the doorbell rang
I was to have finished the work yesterday
I was watching TV when the telephone rang
I won a prize in the spelling competition
I wonder why we play tennis in miniskirts
I would rather starve than work under him
I wrote the wrong address on the envelope
It appears that she might change her mind
It goes without saying that time is money
It is very dangerous to cross this street
It pains me to disagree with your opinion
It was a great privilege working with you
It was a mistake to refuse his assistance
It was he that broke the window yesterday
Last month he had his house painted white

The consequence was that she lost her job

There were three coffee mugs on the table
They are chiseling a statue out of marble
They are matters which we need to discuss

They have been good neighbors to this day
They hurried to the scene of the accident
They probably saw our ship come into port
They will have to cut down their expenses
This house is very comfortable to live in
This is a story about love and friendship
This is the least expensive method of all

I have no one to leave my money to
I just did what they told me to do
I just did what you asked me to do
I just want to know if you love me
I just wanted to drop by to say hi
I owe what I am today to my father
I still have a lot of time for fun
I think I saw a ghost in the woods
I told Tom I wanted to go with him
I told Tom how to get to our house
I tried not to cry in front of him
I want a book to read on the train
I want to go back to where we were
I want to let go of your hands now
I will get him to come and help me
I will get the work done in a week
I wish I could sing as well as Tom
It is kind of you to drive me home
It looks as if it is going to rain
It was so cold that we made a fire
Mary came up to me when she saw me
That cost me a lot in the long run
They went on a trip a few days ago
This is the very best way to do it
Tom has a lot of money in the bank
Tom is a nice guy with a big heart
Tom was in no mood to talk to Mary
We go to Boston as often as we can
You are the very man I want to see
You can use my desk if you want to
You may eat as much as you want to
You may still do it if you want to
You seem to be in a bad mood today
A car in the parking lot is on fire
A dog can run faster than a man can
A map helps us to know where we are
Air is to man what water is to fish
Air is to men what water is to fish
All you have to do is try your best
All you have to do is write it down
He can run as fast as any other boy
He comes to see my son now and then
He has a lot more money than I have
He has eyes at the back of his head
He is a good match for me in tennis
He is as great a poet as ever lived
He is better off than he used to be
He is not too poor to buy a bicycle
He is not what he was ten years ago
He must be a fool to talk like that
He snuck out to meet up with a girl
He told me that I could use his car
He told me to meet him at his house
He was fed up with life in the city
I am no more an artist than you are
I as well as my brother am to blame
I beg you to give me a little water
I did that which she asked me to do
I got tired of lying in bed all day
I had some work that I needed to do
I have a car that was made in Japan
I have no idea why she got so angry
I have no wish to see the man again
I have to take a bus to go anywhere
I hope we can make it to your party
I just got there as fast as I could
I just want to put it all behind us
I just want to say that I was wrong
I left some stuff I need in the car
I lost my purse on my way to school
I loved that movie when I was a kid
I met him once when I was a student
I owe what I am today to my parents
I paid him on the spot for his work
I really wish I knew how to do that
I saw the man knocked down by a car
I still have a lot of pages to read
I take it that we are to come early
I think we get off at the next stop
I told Tom I was going to handle it
I want a knife to cut the rope with
I want my parents to be proud of me
I want to finish the work on my own
I want to show you what Tom gave me
I want you to give each other a hug
I want you to go to Boston with Tom
I was bitten in the leg by that dog
I went to Canada when I was a child
I will never tell a lie from now on
I will wait for you at the bus stop
I wish I could write as well as Tom
I wish that Tom was here to help us
I wonder if you could do me a favor
I would like to go and get my stuff
It is very kind of you to invite me
It will be finished in a day or two
Let me make you a cup of hot coffee
My dad is the best dad in the world
My father is not as old as he looks
My father used to go to work by bus
My goal in life is to be a novelist
She felt as if she had seen a ghost
The child talks as if he were a man
The doctor did a good job on my leg
The old man was almost hit by a car
The word is on the tip of my tongue
This is a map of the city of Sendai
This is a special day for all of us
This is just the type of car I want
This word is both a noun and a verb
Tom came here to ask us to help him
Tom did exactly as I told him to do
Tom is better than I was at his age
Tom told me that Mary was on a diet
Water is to fish what air is to man
You are going to have to pay for it
A wise man would not act in that way
Anyone can do it as long as they try
Either you or I must go in his place
Go early in order to get a good seat
He came to Tokyo at the age of three
He came to see me in a different way
He did it not for me but for himself
He did what he promised to do for me
He gave a tip as a sign of gratitude
He has been on a diet for two months
He is by far the wisest of the three
He is saving in order to buy a house
He is what is called a man of action
He left Japan at the end of the year
He looked as if he knew all about it
He ran so he would get there on time
He ran toward me as fast as he could
He said he would see me the next day
He took pity on me and helped me out
He treats me as if I were a stranger
He was born in a small town in Italy
He will be my deputy while I am away
I am going to have a great day today
I am going to swim a lot this summer
I am just dying for a Coke right now
I am not in the least afraid of dogs
I am so tired that I can hardly walk
I asked him if I could read his book
I awoke to find a burglar in my room
I do not want to reply to his letter
I gave orders I was to be left alone
I got a fish bone stuck in my throat
I got a taxi in front of the station
I got the gist of what he was saying
I got you all right where I want you
I grasped the rope so as not to fall
I had a drink or two before you came
I have a lot of money at my disposal
I have no idea how long it will take
I have no idea how to use this thing
I have no idea what Tom said to Mary
I have no money to buy the book with
I just want to say thanks to you all
I just wanted to say that I love you
I know a guy who has never seen snow
I know whether or not he is an enemy
I know you have to go back to Boston
I love the sound of rain on the roof
I may have left my wallet on the bus
I met him at the end of the platform
I met him on my way home from school
I need to ask you for a little favor
I really do have to get back to work
I refuse to be taken in by her guile
I saw a black cat run into the house
I saw the way Tom was looking at you
I still love the way you smile at me
I talk to Tom on the phone every day
I think Tom is going to like it here
I think we need to go back to Boston
I think you are the one who broke it
I took a shower and then went to bed
I try to help Tom every chance I get
I used to do a lot of volunteer work
I used to play with a couple of boys
I used to take a walk in the morning
I want to be someone you can turn to
I want to know who is coming with us
I want to spend all my time with you
I want to take a closer look at that
I want you focus on the here and now
I was caught in the rain and got wet
I was given a nice watch by my uncle
I was in the hospital a few days ago
I was scared to be alone in the dark
I was so sure this was what I wanted
I went to the bank to take out money
I will be waiting for you in my room
I will do whatever you tell me to do
I will go out if it is fine tomorrow
I will have to be away for some time
I wish I could make up for lost time
I wish I could take back what I said
I wonder if Tom is trying to kill me
I would like to have a cup of coffee
I would like you to go instead of me
I would rather have a cat than a dog
If I could be that guy instead of me
It can be very cold here even in May
It is time for me to take a vacation
It seems to me that we should go now
It took us two hours to get to Tokyo
It was in Kyoto that I first met her
It was in London that I last saw her
It was too nice a day to stay inside
It will cost you more to go by plane
Let me know as soon as he comes back
Let me tell you my side of the story
My father is busy as a bee every day
My father is too busy to take a walk
My son can count up to a hundred now
My teacher put in a good word for me
My uncle has made me what I am today
Our dog was nearly run over by a car
She has about as many stamps as I do
She has an uncle who works in a bank
She has not seen him for a long time
She hit me on the head with a hammer
She used the car to go to the office
The hero died at the end of the book
There are a lot of books in his room
There are a lot of fish in that lake
There are a lot of fish in this lake
There is a lake in front of my house
There was a lot of food in the house
This desk is a little too low for me
This lid is too tight for me to open
Tom and I went to a party last night
Tom does that a lot better than I do
Tom puts gas in his car twice a week
We all know how this is going to end
We set up the tent next to the river
We want Tom to know he can come home
You are the only one who can help me
You can call me at any time you like
You can hang out with us if you want
You may as well tell me all about it
You were the one who gave this to me
A big wave swept the man off the boat
A wise man would not say such a thing
A woman fell from a ship into the sea
A young man waited in line to see him
All I know is that he came from China
All I know is that she left last week
All you have to do is wash the dishes
Ask him whether she is at home or not
Follow me and I will show you the way
He cried out for help in a loud voice
He did a real snow job on my daughter
He did his best never to think of her
He did his best to carry out the plan
He did nothing but lie in bed all day
He gave me what money he had with him
He got hooked on drugs at a young age
He got lost on his way to the village
He had one of his socks on inside out
He has a scraggly beard and a bum leg
He is fatter than when I last saw him
He made up his mind to go there alone
He wants to be a doctor in the future
He was given a gold watch as a reward
He was so sad that he almost went mad
He was too short to get at the grapes
He went to the airport to see her off
He woke up in the middle of the night
His car broke down on the way to work
I am going to work in Osaka next year
I am of the opinion that she is right
I am sorry that my friend is not here
I am used to staying up late at night
I asked her to pick me up around four
I asked him where I could park my car
I bought a few eggs and a little milk
I broke a glass when I did the dishes
I can do this with you or without you
I can lend you some money if you like
I decided to tell her that I love him
I decided to tell him that I love her
I do not want to exert myself in vain
I forgot to write my name on the exam
I found a nice place to have a picnic
I gave the beggar all the money I had
I go to the library from time to time
I got shampoo in my eyes and it hurts
I had to get something out of the car
I have made up my mind to leave Japan
I have something I want to say to you
I have to be in Boston in the morning
I have to confess to you that I snore
I have to go to the bank this morning
I have to say goodbye to a few people
I hope to build a new house next year
I just want to get a little fresh air
I just want to hear you talk about it
I just want to make sure we all agree
I just want to say that I believe you
I just wanted to see what it was like
I know a good lawyer who can help you
I let him spend the night in my house
I like the way she laughs at my jokes
I lost my wallet on the way to school
I love you and I will always love you
I love you more deeply than I can say
I met a friend of mine at the airport
I only know how to play that one song
I recognized her as soon as I saw her
I remember the year when he got a job
I rushed out to see what was going on
I saw this movie a very long time ago
I see him in the library now and then
I suppose you want me to pay for this
I think I ate a little too much today
I thought I told you never to call me
I thought I told you to cut your hair
I thought it was the least I could do
I told you not to call me on weekends
I used to go to that library to study
I waited for you to get out of prison
I want a car that runs on solar power
I want the two of you to quit arguing
I want to borrow your car for an hour
I want to buy a few pairs of trousers
I want to find out where it came from
I want to know what this is all about
I want to know what you see right now
I want to know where you plan to live
I want to see if he really fixed this
I want to sleep in my own bed tonight
I want to talk to you about this list
I want you to know that I believe you
I want you to take a good look around
I want you to tell me about your trip
I wanted to talk to them face to face
I was able to see the smoke from here
I was going to ask you the same thing
I was in the bath when the phone rang
I was just in time for the last train
I was told that I should see a doctor
I went to the hospital to see my wife
I will help you if you are in trouble
I wish you had told me the truth then
It is just a year since I got married
It is stupid of you to believe in him
It is two miles from here to the park
It is very hot in the summer in Japan
Let me give you a ride to the station
My brother eats twice as much as I do
My cousin is a little older than I am
My mother has made me what I am today
Next time it will be my turn to drive
Save up so that you can go to college
She advised him not to buy a used car
She came here as soon as she heard it
She comes to see me from time to time
She had her hat blown off by the wind
She has never gone on a date with him
She likes no one and no one likes her
She looked as if she had seen a ghost
She made up her mind to go to college
She told me that she wanted a pet dog
She told the child to eat up the food
She was too proud to ask him for help
She will be in New York for two weeks
Sit down and take it easy for a while
Taste this wine to see if you like it
That looks like it would be fun to do
The food was not fit for man or beast
The park is in the center of the city
There are still a lot of things to do
There is a lot of crime in big cities
There is no need for you to stay here
There must be a better way to do this
There was a big gold star on the door
This box is too heavy for me to carry
This hat is a little too small for me
This is the lady who wants to see you
This job will call for a lot of money
Today you can eat as much as you want
Tom and his wife have just had a baby
Tom had no choice but to quit his job
Tom is now the star of a reality show
Tom said he had a great time with you
Tom said that he was going to be late
Tom spends a lot of time on the beach
We do this kind of thing all the time
We have had a lot of rain this summer
We have had a lot of snow this winter
We lost sight of the man in the crowd
We need a place to stay for the night
We played a lot of games at the party
We spent a lot of time on our lessons
We waited in the park for a long time
We went to the station to see her off
What an idiot I was to lend her money
What an idiot I was to lend him money
You could hear a pin drop in the room
You may stay here as long as you like
You may want to take a few steps back
You might want to take a look at this
You need to get out of the house more
A man is known by the company he keeps
A moldy loaf of bread lay on the table
All you have to do is press the button
All you have to do is push this button
But of course that was a long time ago
Butter is sold by the pound in the USA
Get out of here before I call the cops
Give me a little time to think it over
Gum got stuck to the bottom of my shoe
Happy is a man who marries a good wife
He ate rice twice a day for many years
He can bend an iron rod with his hands
He can do anything he sets his mind to
He did not get up early in the morning
He died of a heart attack on the stage
He exchanged his old car for a new one
He gave an address to the nation on TV
He gave me a brief outline of the plan
He had the kindness to show me the way
He has been sick in bed this past week
He has the ability to make a good plan
He held out a helping hand to the poor
He is said to have been a good teacher
He is worthy to be captain of our team
He should get to the office in an hour
He told his wife not to buy on impulse
He turned out to be nothing but a liar
He was hit by a car and died instantly
He was holding a large box in his arms
He was just in time for the last train
He went to school only for a few years
He would be very glad to hear the news
Her house is at the foot of a mountain
His death was a great loss to our firm
I am certain that he will quit his job
I am going to make him a serious offer
I am much obliged to you for your help
I am so sorry to have kept you waiting
I am supposed to go to Tokyo next week
I asked him where I should park my car
I asked the boy to throw the ball back
I bumped into an old friend on the bus
I came upon a rare stamp at that store
I can rip you apart with my bare hands
I caught a glimpse of him from the bus
I caught a glimpse of him in the crowd
I dance in my living room all the time
I do not like the way he treats others
I dream of a quiet life in the country
I expect him to come along any day now
I feed my dog just before I eat dinner
I feel like this is going to end badly
I fell in love with a girl from Vienna
I fell in love with her at first sight
I figured out a way to make more money
I found the key that I was looking for
I gave the boy what little money I had
I had enough sense to get out of there
I had to make a speech at short notice
I had to make a speech on short notice
I have a lot of problems at the moment
I have a message I want you to deliver
I have known her since she was a child
I have no regrets for what I have done
I have to charge the battery of my car
I have to live on my very small income
I have to try doing that at least once
I heard Tom say he needed to find Mary
I hope this data will be useful to you
I jumped for joy when I heard the news
I just want to ask you a few questions
I just wanted to make sure I was right
I know Tom and Mary used to be friends
I left you a message at the front desk
I like all of the songs that Tom sings
I like to talk about the good old days
I love her all the more for her faults
I make it a rule never to borrow money
I met an old friend by chance in Kyoto
I met an old student of mine in London
I met him while I was staying in Paris
I never felt this way before I met you
I never meant to put you in any danger
I never want to see you get in trouble
I only wish I could see you more often
I share a house with two of my friends
I stayed home because I had a bad cold
I take my camera with me wherever I go
I think Tom could learn a lot from you
I think Tom is still in love with Mary
I think watching TV is a waste of time
I thought I had a month to finish this
I thought Tom had agreed to do the job
I thought about what a jerk I had been
I thought it was about time we all met
I told you this was going to be boring
I took a taxi because the bus was late
I want to know how you feel about this
I want to stay here a couple more days
I want to talk to you about last night
I want to teach history when I grow up
I want you to give up this stupid plan
I want you to help me with my homework
I want you to stay right where you are
I was in Boston last week with my wife
I was living in Boston a few years ago
I went to school on foot in those days
I wonder if Tom has one I could borrow
I wonder what it feels like to be rich
I would like to get to know you better
I would like to pay with a credit card
I wrote a letter to my parents at home
It is easy for me to solve the problem
It is no use arguing with him about it
It is strange that he has not come yet
It looks like she has a lot of friends
It may be that he will never be famous
It seems that he took me for my sister
It was lucky for you that you found it
It was wise of you to accept his offer
It will go away by itself in two weeks
Japan does a lot of trade with the USA
Japan is not what it was ten years ago
Most of them urged him to take the job
My dad is the best dad in the universe
My pencil fell off the edge of my desk
My sister is too young to go to school
No one has ever said such things to me
No one really knows what a UFO is like
Please put a lot of cream in my coffee
Please tell me how you plan to do that
She acted in a play for the first time
She advised him to go on a strict diet
She asked him if he knew where I lived
She asked me whether I know how to sew
She beat him to death with a golf club
She came into the room with her hat on
She did her best never to think of him
She got all dolled up for her big date
She has never been asked out on a date
She invited him in for a cup of coffee
She lay on a sofa with her eyes closed
She put on her new dress for the party
She stood as close to him as she could
She told me his name after he had left
She was kind enough to show me the way
She went to the airport to see him off
She went to the station to see him off
She will be a beauty when she grows up
The blossoms will be out in a few days
The cat is sitting on top of the table
The child was made a ward of the state
The cruel man beat the dog with a whip
The damage will cost us a lot of money
The doctor told me not to eat too much
The game will be held even if it rains
The man sitting next to me spoke to me
The man you see over there is my uncle
The pen I lost yesterday was a new one
The sky is clear and the sun is bright
There is a very old temple in the town
There might be a gas leak in our house
There must be an easier way to do this
There must be some way we can help Tom
There were a lot of girls at the party
There were a lot of people in the park
They sat in the shade of that big tree
This coffee is too hot for me to drink
This is a bit too tight around my neck
This is a difficult time for all of us
This is the book that I told you about
This is the house in which he was born
This shirt is too small for me to wear
This year has been a lucky one for him
Tom and Mary both wanted a lot of kids
Tom cut his finger on a piece of glass
Tom first met Mary at a cafe in Boston
Tom is fatter than when I last saw him
Tom is the only person who can help me
Tom never said he wanted to go with us
Tom said that you wanted to go with us
Tom wants to get a tattoo on his chest
Tom was so hungry that he ate dog food
Tom went back to his room and lay down
Tom went out for a breath of fresh air
We are entering a new phase in the war
We are happy to have you join our team
We found a poor little cat in the yard
We had to wait for him for ten minutes
We have a lot to learn from each other
We have to clear the snow off the roof
We must buy a new carpet for this room
We used to do a lot of things together
We used to sit on these steps and talk
You are the one that I was looking for
You had better take a bath to get warm
You have to give up sports for a while
You have to put up with all this noise
A girl with blonde hair came to see you
A lot of people swim here in the summer
A rabbit has long ears and a short tail
A trip by boat takes longer than by car
All of the town was destroyed by a fire
All you have to do is follow his advice
Both he and I were members of that club
Doing it that way will take a long time
Give me a ring if you find out anything
Give me a table for two near the window
He and I are pretty much the same build
He arrived on time in spite of the rain
He asked me what was the matter with me
He can play the piano better than I can
He cussed me out for having lied to him
He does not speak unless he is asked to
He drank the whisky as if it were water
He explained to me that he had no money
He fell in love with her at first sight
He gave up his attempt once and for all
He glanced at her and saw she was angry
He got a broken jaw and lost some teeth
He had to go through a lot of hardships
He had to reduce the price of his wares
He has a habit of keeping the door open
He has decided not to go to the meeting
He has more books than he can ever read
He has not paid his portion of the rent
He is going to drive you to the airport
He is not as smart as his older brother
He made a speech in support of the plan
He must stay in the hospital for a week
He owes much of his success to his wife
He ran away at the sight of a policeman
He sat on the sofa with his arms folded
He told me to meet him at his apartment
He was covered in mud from head to foot
He was in prison on a charge of robbery
He was kind enough to tell me the truth
He was walking with a stick in his hand
He went deaf as a result of an accident
He went to work in spite of his illness
He will go to the meeting instead of me
He works too slowly to be helpful to us
He wrote this book at the age of twenty
I already took the pies out of the oven
I always brush my coat when I come home
I am ashamed of having been rude to her
I am bound to him by a close friendship
I am happy to have so many good friends
I am not sure how to pronounce the word
I am planning to go to Europe next week
I can tear you apart with my bare hands
I care a good deal about what you think
I could not keep the tears from my eyes
I cut the paper with a pair of scissors
I do not think their plan will work out
I feel like my head is going to explode
I forgot to put a stamp on the envelope
I found out whose car went off the road
I guess I should get home to the missus
I had my brother put this room in order
I had my suitcase carried up to my room
I had never seen a panda till that time
I had no choice but to accept the offer
I have a friend who works at that store
I have a friend whose wife is a pianist
I have a lot of assignments to do today
I have been living here for a long time
I have left you your dinner in the oven
I have never liked her and I never will
I have three times as many books as him
I have three times as much money as you
I hope Tom likes the gift we bought him
I know a man who can speak Russian well
I know that there was a big church here
I know the reason that she quit her job
I know they are in love with each other
I left a note on your door this morning
I like the kind of music that Tom plays
I lost the watch my father had given me
I lost the watch that my father gave me
I made very short work of the big steak
I need to talk to you about your grades
I never meant for any of this to happen
I only asked if I could borrow the book
I plan to stay at home all day tomorrow
I really wish I could be there with you
I saw the picture you took of that fish
I still have not learned to drive a car
I thank you from the bottom of my heart
I think I could get used to living here
I think you ought to get a little sleep
I thought I told you to clean your room
I thought I told you to trim your beard
I thought for a minute we had a problem
I thought it over and decided not to go
I thought maybe I could buy you a drink
I thought we could eat out on the patio
I thought you used to live in a trailer
I thought you wanted to get out of here
I tried flying from the top of the tree
I turned off the lamp and went to sleep
I used a computer in order to save time
I waited for her for a really long time
I walk my dog in the park every morning
I want a list of everyone in this class
I want all my children to go to college
I want an explanation and I want it now
I want some answers and I want them now
I want to find out who broke the window
I want to hear anything you have to say
I want to hear what everyone has to say
I want to know where they hid the money
I want to speak to the person in charge
I want to talk to you about this report
I was afraid of being put into a closet
I was hoping to raise my kids in Boston
I was relieved to hear that he was safe
I was saving this piece of cake for you
I was very happy when I heard that news
I wear my old coat in weather like this
I went to bed a little later than usual
I went to bed early because I was tired
I went to the airport to meet my father
I will get you a bike for your birthday
I wish there were more hours in the day
I wish we could hear what Tom is saying
I wonder if a human will ever be cloned
I wonder why eggs are sold by the dozen
I would like you to introduce me to her
I would rather stay at home than go out
I would rather walk than wait for a bus
It is imperative for you to act at once
It is stupid of him to behave like that
It is very cold here all the year round
It looks like you did a pretty good job
It took me three days to clean the room
It took me two hours to get to Yokohama
It was given to me by the Queen herself
It was silly of him to refuse her offer
Let me know if you can make it tomorrow
My book has to be somewhere in the room
My cousin works in a shop near our home
My dog is almost half the size of yours
My father used to read to me at bedtime
My father was still at home when I left
My heart beats fast each time I see her
My job will only last two years at most
My mother put a large vase on the shelf
My mother tells me not to study so hard
My teacher warned me not to do it again
Never tell the truth when a lie will do
Now I realise why she was angry with me
Of all these cakes I like this one best
Please lend me this book for a few days
Read the note at the bottom of the page
She asked him how to get to the station
She claimed to be the owner of the land
She gave him all the money that she had
She had my mother take care of the baby
She is likely to live to be one hundred
She managed to learn how to drive a car
She raised her hand for the bus to stop
She said that she was eager to go there
She told him that it would rain all day
She used to go to the museum on Sundays
She wanted him to say that he loved her
She was too short to see over the fence
She went mad after the death of her son
She went to Paris in order to study art
She will be coming to see us again soon
She writes to her son from time to time
Somebody came to see me while I was out
That car is too expensive for me to buy
That child was left in the sun too long
That man died of lung cancer a week ago
The earth is a lot larger than the moon
The ice is too thin to bear your weight
The man who wrote this book is a doctor
The notes are at the bottom of the page
The offer is too good to be turned down
The old man has lived here all his life
The teacher and I sat down face to face
There are a lot of books in the library
There are a lot of bridges in this city
There are a lot of children in the park
There are a lot of hot springs in Japan
There is a bank in front of the station
There is a good chance that he will win
There is a museum just north of the zoo
There is a pair of scissors on the desk
There is no reason for her to scold you
There is no room for romance in my life
There seem to be lots and lots of stars
They are looking for a house to live in
They had had to use what money they had
They heard a gun go off in the distance
They say that a large dam will be built
They seem to be in love with each other
This is the key I have been looking for
This stone was too heavy for me to lift
Those twins look like two peas in a pod
Tom came to Boston hoping to find a job
Tom has asked me to lend him some money
Tom is in pretty good shape for his age
Tom is not going to be happy about this
Tom is one of the richest men in Boston
Tom lost his only son in a car accident
Tom never used to eat so much junk food
Tom poured milk into a bowl for his cat
Tom seems to need to go to the bathroom
Tom told me he knew how to speak French
Tom told us about what he did in Boston
Tom was startled by a knock on the door
Tom was too tired to even smile at Mary
Tom washes his car at least once a week
Try to make good use of your spare time
Turn off the light before you go to bed
We abandoned the plan to go on a picnic
We are not short of oil in this country
We can not agree with you on this point
We decided to lie hidden for a few days
We have to get these people out of here
We have to reduce the cost to a minimum
We hope to come up with a solution soon
We hurried to make up for the lost time
We loaded a lot of luggage into the car
We met in a coffee shop near the campus
We wasted a lot of time looking for Tom
We were waiting for him for a long time
Yesterday was very cold so I wore a hat
You are free to leave any time you wish
You can stay with us for the time being
You can use this pen for the time being
You could do it if you really wanted to
You have only to give him a little help
You might want to try working out a bit
You need to be more careful from now on
You remind me of someone I used to know
You should have told me a long time ago
You will not be able to catch the train
A baby has no knowledge of good and evil
A full moon is shining bright in the sky
A green banana is not ripe enough to eat
A new hotel will be built here next year
A police officer told me to stop the car
A small gain is better than a great loss
A trip to America is out of the question
A trip to the Riviera should do you good
A true friend would not say such a thing
All I want is someone special in my life
An old castle stands on top of the cliff
Cats have the ability to see in the dark
Do whatever it takes to get the job done
Give me some coffee if there is any left
Give up smoking if you want to live long
Hang your jacket on the hook by the door
He blew on his fingers to make them warm
He borrowed a lot of money from the bank
He goes to sleep with the lights left on
He had a problem with the front door key
He has a fear that his brother will fail
He has made the company what it is today
He is a little light for a sumo wrestler
He is as clever as any of his classmates
He kept us waiting for more than an hour
He likes to dress up as a police officer
He lost both his parents at an early age
He lost sight of his friend in the crowd
He made a little statue out of soft clay
He made for the door and tried to escape
He rushed into the room with his coat on
He saw the accident on the way to school
He sent his son out to get the newspaper
He stays a long time every time he comes
He stood by me whenever I was in trouble
He suggested that I write to her at once
He thought it over and decided not to go
He told me he wanted to quit the company
He told me that his father was a teacher
He told me to meet him at the restaurant
He took the coat off because it was warm
He tried in vain to open the locked door
He was a general in the Second World War
He was robbed of his money on the street
He was the last person I expected to see
He went to the store to buy some oranges
He works all night and he sleeps all day
Her only desire is to see him again soon
His hair is so long it reaches the floor
Hold still a moment while I fix your tie
I agree with what you say to some extent
I always rely on him in times of trouble
I always take a bath before going to bed
I am afraid of what the teacher will say
I am not pleased with what you have done
I am tired of hearing you moan and groan
I asked her to marry me and she accepted
I asked my teacher what I should do next
I bet five dollars that he will not come
I can cook better than I can play tennis
I caught a cold and was in bed yesterday
I could rip you apart with my bare hands
I decided to go out and explore the town
I do not believe in the existence of God
I explained the rules of the game to him
I finally found a use for this old thing
I finished the work in less than an hour
I forgot that Tom used to live in Boston
I found a pair of gloves under the chair
I get more than two hundred emails a day
I guess I could wait a little bit longer
I guess you never learned how to do this
I had a sharp pain in my chest yesterday
I had a very hard time writing the paper
I had to swerve to avoid hitting the dog
I have been his greatest fan all my life
I have been reading this for a few hours
I have my supper at a quarter past seven
I have no idea what that guy is thinking
I have no time to explain this in detail
I have to leave early to catch the train
I heard that he left town and moved east
I hope things will turn out well for you
I just think we need to be extra careful
I just wanted to ask you a few questions
I know that this is important for us all
I like the kind of music that Tom writes
I missed the train by only a few minutes
I plan to reply to his letter right away
I put my gloves on inside out by mistake
I put on my favorite dress for the party
I ran across an old friend near the bank
I really do hope we can still be friends
I saw a dirty dog coming into the garden
I simply wanted to see what was going on
I spend a lot of time listening to music
I stepped aside so that he could come in
I stopped and waited for the car to pass
I suggest that you try to get some sleep
I take it for granted that you will join
I think I will take a vacation this week
I think you might want to check this out
I thought I told you not to make trouble
I thought that I told you to stay behind
I thought that was the right thing to do
I thought you went to your room to sleep
I thought you were going to fix the sink
I throw myself on the mercy of the court
I told them what I thought of their plan
I told you to stay away from my daughter
I used to play tennis with him on Sunday
I want to be with you more than anything
I want to examine the body of the victim
I want to go over these numbers with you
I want to go to Australia with my family
I want to have a proper house and garden
I want to know how this happened and why
I want to know who threw the first punch
I want to spend more time alone with you
I want to wait and see what Tom proposes
I was a high school student at that time
I was about to leave when the phone rang
I was afraid of getting lost in the dark
I was attacked and robbed on my way home
I was just about to come looking for you
I was kind of surprised to see Tom there
I was more than a little shocked by this
I was right on the spot when it happened
I was unable to go to his birthday party
I will ask him where he went last Sunday
I will badly miss you if you leave Japan
I will give you a bike for your birthday
I will give you what little money I have
I will go out after I finish my homework
I wish I had studied harder for the test
I wish Tom would help me weed the garden
I wish Tom would spend more time at home
I wish you did not have so many problems
I wonder if anybody knows how to do this
I wonder if she is staying at that hotel
I wonder what all of them have in common
I would like for him to write more often
I would rather feed my dog before we eat
It happened that we were on the same bus
It is dangerous to fly in this heavy fog
It is easy for me to answer the question
It is evident that he has made a mistake
It is no use your trying to persuade him
It is not appropriate for you to do this
It never occurred to me that he loved me
It says on the label to take two tablets
It seems that there will be a storm soon
It took me five hours to finish the work
It was easy for him to solve the problem
It was my turn to straighten up the room
It was the most painful thing in my life
It will be some time before he gets well
Let me heat it up some leftovers for you
Marriage is the union of a man and woman
My brother is old enough to go to school
My dream is to travel in a space shuttle
My father used to say that time is money
My friend said he had bought a new watch
My room is three times as large as yours
My sister works as a secretary at a bank
My sister works in a bank as a secretary
No wild tigers are to be found in Africa
Nobody was allowed to go out of the room
Our car ran out of gas after ten minutes
Our car ran out of gas after two minutes
Our eyes take time to adjust to the dark
Our success was due in part to good luck
Please tell me how to get to the airport
She advised him not to use too much salt
She always speaks to him in a loud voice
She asked him how to turn on the machine
She did it for the good of the community
She froze at the sight of the big spider
She gets about with the help of a walker
She had no choice but to accept her fate
She has a cold and is absent from school
She is always at the bottom of the class
She spoke English to me just to show off
She suggested that I take him to the zoo
She tried to persuade him to go with her
She was stupid enough to go out with him
She was the last woman I expected to see
She writes to her son every now and then
Thank you for helping me find a good job
Thank you for teaching me how to do this
That he is a genius is clear to everyone
That house is the place where I was born
That way I kill two birds with one stone
The age of nuclear power is not yet over
The baby has been crying for a long time
The boss has a good opinion of your work
The boy did nothing but cry all day long
The cake got crushed by the jar of juice
The canteen had not a drop of water left
The coffee is too bitter for me to drink
The cook put the food in the dumb waiter
The cost of living in Tokyo is very high
The cost of living is very high in Tokyo
The doctor instructed me to go on a diet
The family had a hard time after the war
The girl I told you about lives in Kyoto
The girl who works at the bakery is cute
The people I work with are all very kind
The post office is not too far from here
The price of gold varies from day to day
The ship sank with all her crew on board
The shop is just in front of the station
The station is in the center of the city
The truck made a sharp turn to the right
The two had been enemies for a long time
The two of them were never to meet again
There are many good reasons not to do it
There is a lot of furniture in this room
There is an urgent need for a new policy
There is an urgent need for a new system
There is no necessity for you to do that
There is nothing I can do to change that
There is nothing for you to be afraid of
There is sand at the bottom of the ocean
There was a small box inside the big box
They are now either in Kyoto or in Osaka
They studied the map to find a short cut
They were in that room with me all night
This car was cheap enough for him to buy
This color is a bit darker than that one
This is a good book for children to read
This is one of the things he always says
This is the worst movie I have ever seen
To try to bring it back would be foolish
Tom always wants to sit in the front row
Tom and Mary are getting ready to go out
Tom armed himself with a gun and a knife
Tom could learn a thing or two from Mary
Tom fainted as soon as he saw the needle
Tom got mad at Mary because she was late
Tom is head over heels in love with Mary
Tom is just a little bit shorter than me
Tom knew that Mary was trying to do that
Tom made a great deal of money last year
Tom said Boston is a nice place to visit
Tom says he already knows how to do that
Tom told me where you hid the gold coins
Tom wanted me to meet him at the station
Tom was mugged on his way home from work
Tom went to Japan on a work holiday visa
We are all but ready for the cold winter
We have a few surprises in store for her
We have a gig at the club tomorrow night
We have a new coach and some new players
We have to work hard to fix this problem
We make progress only one step at a time
We must sleep at least seven hours a day
We need to find somebody who can help us
We should take a break and have some tea
We want you to be more careful next time
We were shocked at the news of his death
You are carrying your joke a bit too far
You could count to ten when you were two
You gave me this picture a long time ago
You had better ask him which way to take
You have little to gain and much to lose
You have to report to the police at once
You must go outside if you want to smoke
You need to look at the big picture here
You should make sure of it before you go
You took the words right out of my mouth
A fire can spread faster than you can run
A heavy snow kept us from going to school
A lot of people think that bats are birds
Both of my parents are not strict with me
Close your eyes and tell me what you hear
Each of us has to be careful when driving
Few people live to be more than a hundred
Gas was escaping from a crack in the pipe
He begged his father to buy him a bicycle
He does nothing but watch TV all day long
He explained to me how to use the machine
He finally achieved what he set out to do
He gave his daughter quite a lot of money
He gave me not only advice but also money
He had his car stolen in that parking lot
He has no distinct idea of how to proceed
He has spent ten years in jail for murder
He is writing a letter to his parents now
He must be stupid to believe such a thing
He promised me that he would come at four
He saw himself as the savior of the world
He stretched out his arm to take the book
He thinks that his success is due to luck
He was covered with mud from head to foot
He was listening to the music in his room
He was never to see his native land again
He was not able to join in the discussion
He was the first man to cross the Pacific
He went above and beyond the call of duty
He will soon get used to the climate here
He would like to take part in the contest
Her father left her the house in his will
Her husband is a member of the Oda family
His father left him the house in his will
His laziness is a bad sign for the future
His name is known to everyone in the town
I am afraid it will rain in the afternoon
I am very grateful to you for your advice
I am very thankful to you for your advice
I asked Tom why he wanted to study French
I asked for a seat in the smoking section
I can hear a cat scratching at the window
I caught up on all my homework last night
I could not persuade him that it was true
I feel sleepy when I listen to soft music
I found it difficult to be kind to others
I guess we should go get something to eat
I had back surgery a couple of months ago
I had not waited long before the bus came
I had to walk because there were no taxis
I have a feeling that she will come today
I have a few friends in the United States
I have a friend whose father is a teacher
I have been wanting to ask you a question
I have no idea how long I was unconscious
I have nothing to tell you for the moment
I have three times more books than he has
I have three times more money than you do
I have to talk to Tom about what happened
I heard a noise coming from the next room
I hope everything will be fine in the end
I intend to stay in Nagoya for three days
I just got out of prison three months ago
I just want to wish you a merry Christmas
I know that you have issues with your mom
I know this is hard for you to understand
I miss the hustle and bustle of city life
I need to find something to cut this with
I pressed the button to turn the radio on
I presume that he has paid the money back
I ran into an old friend at Tokyo Station
I stood under a tree to avoid getting wet
I suggest that your son come to our party
I take a bath every morning in the summer
I thanked him from the bottom of my heart
I think that this was not a wise decision
I think this machine is in need of repair
I thought my parents would be proud of me
I took it for granted that she would come
I took it for granted that you would come
I want the same jacket as you are wearing
I want to find out what Tom did yesterday
I want to see the director of the company
I want to take part to the next triathlon
I was offered the choice of tea or coffee
I went home in order to change my clothes
I went to bed a little earlier than usual
I will be studying when you come at seven
I will give this book to whoever wants it
I will teach you how to skate next Sunday
I wish I could break the habit of smoking
I wonder if someone could help me do this
I wonder if you could get me another beer
I wonder where Tom learned how to do that
I would prefer to speak to you in private
It cost him ten dollars to get the ticket
It is definite that he will go to America
It is important for them to do their best
It is no use trying to solve this problem
It may have been Tom that wrote this note
It seems that the rainy season has set in
It seems to me that this is too expensive
It takes about ten minutes to boil an egg
It would be better if you read more books
Let me see the pictures you took in Paris
Look out for cars when you cross the road
Making money is not the only goal in life
My father gave me a watch for my birthday
My father has never been sick in his life
My father is going to go abroad next week
My legs hurt because I walked a lot today
My mother taught me how to make miso soup
Please let me know when you come to Osaka
Remember that we are all in the same boat
She acted as if she knew nothing about it
She bought six yards of cloth for a dress
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar
She had good reason to file for a divorce
She is well known in both India and China
She must have known that she had a cancer
She never managed to pay the bill on time
She put some of the ointment on her hands
She sat still for fear of waking the baby
She spent a lot of time writing her essay
She stayed in that area for a short while
She suggested that I write to him at once
She thought she could get him to like her
She told the story with tears in her eyes
She was advised by him to give up smoking
She was asked not to speak at the meeting
She was so angry that she could not speak
She went for a walk with him this morning
She will be a famous artist in the future
She will be back in less than ten minutes
Some of the apples in the box were rotten
Ten years is a really long period of time
Thank you for helping me stick to my diet
Thank you very much for all you have done
That is new a shop which opened last week
That is the girl whose father is a doctor
The Japanese eat rice at least once a day
The apple does not fall far from the tree
The cost of living in Japan is going down
The doctor advised me not to eat too much
The leaves of the trees began to turn red
The number of boys in our class is thirty
The picture of the tower was out of focus
The place where he lives is far from town
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
The skin is the largest organ of the body
The town is two miles away from the coast
The young lady carried a child in her arm
There is a little milk left in the bottle
There were a lot of people at the concert
They gathered at a farm in New York State
Think it over and tell me what you decide
This book is easy enough for them to read
This cake tastes like it has cheese in it
This is the magazine I spoke to you about
Tom feels that his team will win the game
Tom fell over and landed flat on his face
Tom has been a prison guard for ten years
Tom has been on death row for three years
Tom has to speak French every day at work
Tom is just trying to get under your skin
Tom lived in Boston until a few years ago
Tom looked at Mary and then winked at her
Tom put the screws in a small plastic bag
Tom saw a large rat run across the street
Tom told Mary where he hid the gold coins
Tom wanted Mary to help him in the garden
Tom wanted Mary to say that she loved him
Tom wants to keep things the way they are
Tom went to his study and locked the door
We decided to leave him alone for a while
We have a good team and everyone knows it
We have plenty of work to do this morning
We must get to the bottom of this mystery
We must talk her out of this foolish plan
We sat in the very back of the auditorium
We were supposed to be here two weeks ago
What you said does not apply to this case
You are mistaken if you think he is wrong
You can come to visit us anytime you want
You can park on either side of the street
You can see the whole city from this hill
You can use my car if you drive carefully
You have to turn in the reports on Monday
You look like a little girl in that dress
You may give the book to whoever wants it
You must be careful not to make him angry
You still have a lot to learn about women
Your camera is only half the size of mine
A camel is a horse designed by a committee
A glass of water will make you feel better
A honeymoon in Canada costs a lot of money
A new bridge is being built over the river
A square is both a rectangle and a rhombus
A stream of people came out of the theater
A tall building was built next to my house
A young man broke into my house last night
All this damage is the result of the storm
Any man wearing a toupee fears a windy day
Cleveland was not sure the boy was his son
Either you or he has to attend the meeting
Every even number is the sum of two primes
Fold the napkins and put one by each plate
Grandma is three and a half times your age
He asked me if I knew her telephone number
He became more and more famous as a critic
He came near to being drowned in the river
He caught hold of a rope and saved himself
He found it impossible to go there on foot
He gave back all the money he had borrowed
He gave us not only clothes but some money
He gives an apple to the teacher every day
He had to share a bedroom with his brother
He handed over all his property to his son
He has a chance of equaling the old record
He has been living in Ankara for six years
He has the bad habit of chewing his pencil
He is not ashamed of his father being poor
He is one of the greatest artists in Japan
He is ready to join us under one condition
He is reputed the best lawyer in this city
He is the president of the company in fact
He often tells us we must help one another
He parked his car in front of the building
He promised to meet him at the coffee shop
He quit smoking for the sake of his health
He ran to the station and caught the train
He reminds me of his father when he speaks
He said the same thing over and over again
He says he is leaving the country for good
He slowly let the clutch out and drove off
He was ashamed of having done such a thing
He was standing at the top of the mountain
He who knows the most often says the least
He would not give it up without a struggle
He writes to his mother every now and then
Her hands are full taking care of the baby
His family has to live on his small income
I almost forgot to pay my bills last month
I always wear boots when it rains or snows
I am interested in the cello and the piano
I am tired of listening to his long speech
I broke a bone in my foot while exercising
I could kick myself for not bringing a map
I could never forgive myself if I did that
I could not stand my house being torn down
I did everything I could to be your friend
I felt very relieved when I heard the news
I forgot to attach a stamp to the envelope
I found it difficult to get along with him
I had a really great time with your family
I had some things to do before the meeting
I had some work that needed to be finished
I have a friend whose father is a magician
I have left my umbrella in the phone booth
I have no money to buy the dictionary with
I have to take my medicine every six hours
I have to withdraw some cash from the bank
I hope that what you are eating is healthy
I just want to keep things nice and simple
I know what Tom and Mary are going through
I like to play music written by my friends
I made a big mistake when choosing my wife
I never realized how much I would miss you
I noticed that I had slept past my station
I now view life differently than I used to
I recognize that what he says is the truth
I remember the day you were born very well
I should have talked to you first about it
I spent the whole day in reading the novel
I spoke to him about it over the telephone
I study French with Tom three times a week
I think I can solve this problem by myself
I think maybe Tom has something else to do
I think this sweater will look good on you
I want it delivered to me by noon tomorrow
I want to exchange this for a smaller size
I want to know more about your school life
I want to show you something in the office
I was a fool for marrying someone like her
I was rereading the letters you sent to me
I will get you a bicycle for your birthday
I will take the one that is more expensive
I will try to live up to your expectations
I will visit my uncle in Kyoto this summer
I wish the fedora would come back in style
I wonder what has made him change his mind
I would like to repay him for his kindness
In Japan a new school year starts in April
It is completely natural for her to be mad
It is doubtful whether he will come or not
It is high time you started a new business
It is more blessed to give than to receive
It is no exaggeration to call him a genius
It is not easy to learn a foreign language
It is possible that he has had an accident
It may have been Tom who broke this window
It seems those two are made for each other
It took me three hours to write the letter
It was childish of him to behave like that
Last summer I had a chance to visit London
Last week my mother came down with the flu
Life as it is is very uninteresting to him
Listening to music is a great way to relax
Most Japanese eat rice at least once a day
Mother looked at me with tears in her eyes
My brother is a member of the rescue squad
My brother is holding a camera in his hand
My cat is going to have kittens next month
My friends and I went to a party yesterday
My mother spends a lot of money on clothes
My name is known to everybody in my school
My parents have kicked me out of the house
My son can already count up to one hundred
No one has yet found the fountain of youth
Not all of us are born with musical talent
One of the tigers has escaped from the zoo
Please allow me to ask you a few questions
Read over your paper before you hand it in
She advised him not to go there by himself
She always has to be the one giving orders
She believed him when he said he loved her
She drank two glasses of wine at the party
She gave me a watch for a birthday present
She gave me an album as a birthday present
She goes to market every day to buy things
She had the box carried to the first floor
She had to share a bedroom with her sister
She handed him the money that she owed him
She has been asked to sit on the committee
She is on the verge of a nervous breakdown
She loves him now more than she did before
She spent her life in pursuit of the truth
She was advised by him to give up drinking
She went into her room to change her dress
She will not be able to come here tomorrow
She works as a nurse in the local hospital
Smoking has a great deal to do with cancer
Swimming is one thing I can do fairly well
Take an umbrella with you in case it rains
That blow on the head knocked him out cold
That kind of machine is yet to be invented
The boy lifted the heavy box with one hand
The car is parked in front of the building
The earth is similar to an orange in shape
The firm went under due to lack of capital
The girl tried hard to hold back her tears
The long discussion came to an end at last
The motive for the murder is not yet known
The old man served the king for many years
The pay is terrible and the hours are long
The phone rang while I was taking a shower
The thief ran away when he saw a policeman
The time will come when you will regret it
The top of the mountain is covered in snow
The wind blew the umbrella out of her hand
There are a lot of poodles under the couch
There are various ways to get to her house
There is a place for everyone in the world
There is an urgent need for food and water
There is no point in pretending to be sick
There is no room for doubt about his guilt
There is no use waiting for her any longer
They kept it secret that they were in love
They say she is the kindest woman on earth
They set a new record for the longest kiss
They set the time and place of the wedding
They were stuck for hours in a traffic jam
This book is too difficult for you to read
This is not my first time riding a bicycle
This is the place where my father was born
This is the restaurant that I often eat at
This road is too narrow for trucks to pass
This suitcase is too heavy for me to carry
This was a stupid idea from the very start
This work calls for a high degree of skill
Tom and Mary both wanted a lot of children
Tom and Mary split up after their son died
Tom could swim when he was three years old
Tom is obviously very good at what he does
Tom saw Mary sitting alone on a park bench
Tom should let Mary know that he likes her
Tom takes the kids to the school every day
Tom told Mary that he had a new girlfriend
Tom tried to persuade Mary to stay at home
Tom used to be in a relationship with Mary
We are going to visit our aunt next Sunday
We had a spell of fine weather last autumn
We had to pay ten thousand yen in addition
We have a lot to learn from other cultures
We have not heard from him since last year
We have to make the most of this situation
We have to stop him from drinking any more
We must get together for a drink some time
We need to band together to beat the enemy
We walked up and down the streets of Kyoto
We were talking to each other all the time
We will employ a man who can speak English
What I really want is something hot to eat
You are old enough to make your own living
You can borrow an umbrella if you need one
You can call me this afternoon if you want
You found me where no one else was looking
You had better go home as soon as possible
You have changed since I saw you last year
You have to get this work finished by noon
You must be worn out after working all day
You must go and see the headmaster at once
You ought to have started half an hour ago
You should keep clear of that side of town
A Japanese would not have said such a thing
A bead of sweat started forming on his brow
A blast of cold air swept through the house
A few glasses of wine can loosen the tongue
A friend to everybody is a friend to nobody
A great change has come about after the war
A huge tanker just pulled out from the dock
A hundred people were hurt in a train wreck
A woman was hanging the washing on the line
An awning broke his fall and saved his life
Computers save us a lot of time and trouble
Do this work by tomorrow if at all possible
Feel free to comment on any point made here
Few people live to be one hundred years old
He attempted to climb the fence to no avail
He called on state troops to end the strike
He came to school even though he was unwell
He comes every day to visit his sick friend
He gave the police a false name and address
He gets a reasonable salary as a bank clerk
He has no equal in the field of electronics
He is alert to every chance of making money
He is precisely the one you are looking for
He is talking of going to Spain this winter
He lost his balance and fell off the ladder
He often looks back on his high school days
He painted the picture which is on the wall
He put his tools away after he had finished
He said that he had seen the picture before
He sleeps during the day and works at night
He speaks English as if he were an American
He was having lunch when I entered the room
He was scared when the monkey jumped at him
He went fishing in a river near the village
He who sleeps with dogs wakes up with fleas
He will have no chance of winning her heart
He would do whatever it takes to make money
Her hair was long enough to reach the floor
His apparent anger proved to be only a joke
His doctor told him to cut down on drinking
His name is known to everybody in this area
His salary is too low to support his family
Hurry up and you can still catch your train
I almost forgot to tell Tom about the party
I already sent an email to the support team
I am accustomed to eating this sort of food
I am hungry because I did not eat breakfast
I am not as interested in literature as you
I am sure of his winning the speech contest
I asked Tom why he had never gotten married
I asked Tom why he had never studied French
I awoke to find everything had been a dream
I became very sleepy after a bit of reading
I fell asleep while I was doing my homework
I got a letter from an old friend yesterday
I had a little difficulty in getting a taxi
I had almost finished my work when she came
I had my wallet stolen from my inner pocket
I had no intention of going there by myself
I hate the world because the world hates me
I have a boiled egg for breakfast every day
I have a client waiting in the waiting room
I have abandoned the idea of buying a house
I have been waiting for almost half an hour
I have done everything I was supposed to do
I have seen this happen over and over again
I have to change the batteries in the radio
I hurried in order to catch the first train
I know someone who has never seen the ocean
I looked in my closet for something to wear
I must offer you an apology for coming late
I never dreamed that I would meet her again
I never dreamed that I would meet her there
I rode a horse for the first time yesterday
I stopped at the supermarket on my way home
I think he can get along with his neighbors
I think my boyfriend is spying on my emails
I think that China will play an active role
I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me
I want this more than anything in the world
I want to have something to remember you by
I want to see a doctor about my stomachache
I was about to leave when the doorbell rang
I was absent from school because I was sick
I was afraid that I might hurt his feelings
I went there for the purpose of meeting him
I will give you a bicycle for your birthday
I would like to express my gratitude to her
I would rather stay at home than go fishing
It is dangerous to jump onto a moving train
It is hard to adapt this story for children
It is impossible for him to give up smoking
It is impossible for us to cross that river
It was raining off and on all day yesterday
It was so cold yesterday that I stayed home
Japan plays a key role in the world economy
Making such a decision is not an easy thing
My dog follows me whenever I leave the room
My father has never gotten sick in his life
My father smokes a pack of cigarettes a day
My folks used to tell me stories about that
My sister sang an English song at the party
New York State is almost as large as Greece
No one expected him to be a candidate again
No one knows what will happen in the future
Nobody wants to work outdoors on a cold day
Our teacher warned him not to be late again
People used to laugh at him behind his back
Please bring me the book next time you come
Please let me off in front of that building
Please tell me the reason why she got angry
Please use a pencil to write down your name
She advised him that he should stay at home
She advised him to go to the police station
She approached him with a smile on her face
She danced with him at the high school prom
She earns half as much money as her husband
She has been dating him for about two years
She is curious to find who sent the flowers
She is no less beautiful than her sister is
She is very becoming in a black party dress
She is what one would call a cultured woman
She left the old newspapers lying in a heap
She relied on the medicine as a last resort
She tried to conceal her grief at the party
She was advised by him to get more exercise
She was indignant when I said she was lying
She was seen at a restaurant with her lover
She went out of the room with downcast eyes
She worships him and the ground he walks on
Some Germans work for only one euro an hour
Some people talk too much and do too little
Some stars began to appear in the night sky
Someone has torn two pages out of this book
The animal struggled to get out of the cage

The doctor told Tom to stop eating dog food
The driver told us which bus we should take
The engineer told us how to use the machine
The film I told you about has been released
The girl lifted the heavy box with one hand
The girl was busy making tea for her friend
The girls are going to be late this evening
The grand prize is a kiss from the princess
The job comes with a lot of fringe benefits
The mere sight of a mosquito makes her sick
The news that he was still alive reached us
The orange left a strange taste in my mouth
The pain went away because I took the pills
The place was packed to the brim last night
The plumber used many tools to fix our sink
The police got to the scene of the accident
The prince was changed into a tree by magic
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
The road which leads to the hotel is narrow
The skyscraper is in the center of the city
The thieves opened the door with a pass key
The truth is that the parents were to blame
The two boys look more alike than I thought
The yen is rising and the dollar is falling
There are plenty of fresh eggs on the table
There has to be a first time for everything
There is a library in every city in America
There is a little hope that he will succeed
There is no market for these goods in Japan
There is only one store on the whole island
They say there are ghosts in this old house
This book is much more useful than that one
This dictionary has been of great use to me
This is one of the best restaurants in town
This screwdriver is too small to be any use
Tom already knows you want to quit your job
Tom and Mary insult each other all the time
Tom and Mary speak to each other in English
Tom asked Mary to drive John to the airport

Tom is saving money for a trip to Australia
Tom is the tallest boy on our football team
Tom said he had more important things to do
Tom said he had plenty of friends in Boston
Tom said he was calling from his cell phone
Tom talked too much and let the secret slip
Tom told me that he liked working with Mary
Tom warned Mary to stay away from his house
We divided ten dollars among the five of us
We had hardly started when it began to rain
We have problems that need to be dealt with
We must find something to plug up this hole
We thought it wise not to continue our trip
Whether we go or not depends on the weather
You are old enough to take care of yourself
You could be a little nicer to your brother
You had better do as the doctor advised you
You must not lose sight of your main object
You never know what life may throw your way
You should make sure that you tie a bowline
You will be able to play tennis better soon
You will get the worst beating of your life
You will have to apologize when you see him
Your wish will come true in the near future
A group of children were playing in the park
A holiday this summer is out of the question
A lot of people in our neighborhood own guns
A secure income is an important thing for me

All the signs are that she is getting better
Among the guests were the mayor and his wife

Cuban cigars are among the best in the world
English is spoken in many parts of the world
Fish like carp and trout live in fresh water
Going to this school requires a lot of money
He attended the meeting in place of his boss
He contributed a lot of money to the charity
He deprived my little sister of all her toys
He got his car washed at the filling station
He has not written to us since last February
He is concerned about the result of the exam
He knows better than to believe such a thing
He read the entire Old Testament in one year
He said he was suffering from a bad headache
He studied hard in order to get into college
He tends to get angry when people oppose him
He was scolded by his teacher for being lazy
He would like to know whether you play chess
He wrote a book about the American Civil War
I am calling to make an appointment with you
I am looking for a book about medieval Spain
I am not wholly convinced that you are right
I am tired of eating at the school cafeteria
I felt my heart pound after running a little
I found it difficult to put it into practice
I found that there was a little girl sobbing
I guess I should have read it more carefully
I had never heard anyone speak of him before
I have heard nothing from him for five years
I have to give back the book before Saturday
I hope you will succeed in winning the prize
I just assumed everything was going to be OK
I look forward to seeing you again very soon
I rented an apartment when I lived in Boston
I should have gone to bed earlier last night
I skipped out on my appointment with my boss
I take it for granted that people are honest
I telephoned to make sure that he was coming
I think we all should have been more careful
I think we should stick to the original plan
I thought that you were able to speak French
I thought the company had sent Tom to Boston
I want to make a complaint to the management
I wanted to save this for a special occasion
I was able to succeed because of your advice
I was probably thirty years old at that time
I went skiing for the first time this winter
I will explain the situation to you later on
I will wait till you have written the letter
I wonder if I should really become a teacher
I wonder if you have something to write with
I wonder what happens if I press this button
It is difficult for him to solve the problem
It is easy to add numbers using a calculator
It is forbidden for you to touch that switch
It is less muggy today than it was yesterday
It is not easy to be understood by everybody
It is not easy to distinguish good from evil
It is on this point that our opinions differ
It is true that she teaches French at school
It is uncertain whether he will agree or not
It looks like the dog wants something to eat
It makes no difference whether you go or not
It took me three hours to finish my homework
It was not until yesterday that I noticed it
Lightning lit up the room every now and then
Mary kept on working in spite of her illness
Maybe Tom was the one who stole your bicycle
Maybe you should have a little talk with Tom
My father always speaks in a very loud voice
My father is arriving at the station at five
My friends gave us a whirlwind tour of Paris
My friends stood by me during the court case
My mother faints every time she sees a mouse
My new assistant is eager to learn the ropes
Our eyes take time to adjust to the darkness
Please let me know if you have any questions
Rain is the water that falls from the clouds
She asked him if he knew my telephone number
She burst into tears when she heard the news
She explained to him how to solve the puzzle
She had a great attachment to that old house
She had lived in Hiroshima until she was ten
She has known him since they were very young
She is going to wash the bike this afternoon
She is more of an acquaintance than a friend
She seems to be involved in that murder case
She showed her courage in the face of danger
She spends way too much time surfing the web
She told her children to put away their toys
She was playing with her sister at that time
She was the last to cross the finishing line
Some animals can sense the coming of a storm
Something is wrong with the engine of my car
Take off your hat when you enter a classroom
Take your coat off and make yourself at home
Take your umbrella with you in case it rains
Thank you for helping me keep out of trouble
That experience left a bad taste in my mouth
That writer is well known all over the world
The Statue of Liberty is located in New York
The apples that he sent to me were delicious
The bar was so crowded you could hardly move
The big fire reduced the whole town to ashes
The doctor was not sure what the trouble was
The family is the most basic unit of society
The fire broke out after the staff went home
The first casualty of every war is the truth
The government has imposed a new tax on wine
The house is going to feel empty without you
The house where I live belongs to my parents
The information you gave me is of little use
The majority of those men worked in the mine
The old church by the lake is very beautiful
The plumber pumped the water out of the pipe
The post office is just across from the bank
The robot was so lifelike that it was creepy
The royal jewels are kept under lock and key

They regarded the man as a danger to society
They went on an expedition to the North Pole
This is not the first time this has happened
This is the third longest river in the world
This is the village where my father was born
This painting is worth a great deal of money
This summer we had an unusual amount of rain
This type of thing never used to happen here
Tom and Mary have just gotten back to Boston
Tom asked Mary who had given her the picture
Tom asked me to bring my own eating utensils

Tom wanted to spend some time in the country
Tom went into the kitchen to get some coffee
Tom wishes for his son to inherit his estate
Vivaldi wrote a lot of music for the bassoon
We are going to have a meeting here tomorrow
We are prone to judge every one by ourselves
We have had more snow than usual this winter
We have no hot water because the pipes broke
We saw the lady carried away to the hospital
We sent you an email with an activation link
We should determine what is to be done first
We will have some visitors one of these days
We wish him the best in his future endeavors
What seems simple to you seems complex to me
You are the most important person in my life
You can always count on him in any emergency
You can reach me at the address written here
You must put an end to this foolish behavior
You never know when this might come in handy
You should always save money for a rainy day
You will soon get used to speaking in public
Your PhD thesis has to be written in English
Your dream will come true in the near future
Your effort will be rewarded in the long run

Convincing Tom to do the right thing was hard
Five thousand dollars is a large sum of money
Half of the bananas in the basket were rotten
He can speak not only English but also German
He could not stand being kept waiting so long
He faked his death and assumed a new identity
He glanced at her with no sign of recognition
He is fighting with his back against the wall
He is not as intelligent as his older brother
He is one of the greatest scientists in Japan
He listened to the music with his eyes closed
He lived on crackers and water for three days
He marches to the beat of a different drummer
He never fails to give her a birthday present
He played the guitar and she played the piano
He reached across the table and shook my hand
He said that he would come back here tomorrow
He screwed up his courage and proposed to her
He seldom does anything he really hates to do
He showed courage in the face of great danger
He spends his evenings in front of his laptop
He told us he had gone through many hardships
He took my umbrella without so much as asking
He was a famous poet and a competent diplomat
He was absent from school because he was sick
He was afraid that he might hurt her feelings
He was eager to return to school in September
He would like to take part in the competition
Her ability to write with her foot is amazing
His absence gave birth to all sorts of rumors
His income is too small to support his family
His wife has started to work out of necessity
I advise you never to live beyond your income
I am deeply grateful to you for your kindness
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon
I am looking forward to seeing you again soon
I am very happy to hear about your engagement
I can easily give up chocolate to lose weight
I could feel the sweat trickling down my back
I decided to take his side against the others
I finally talked her into lending me the book
I forgot to write the address on the envelope
I gathered from this letter that he was angry
I had never seen such a beautiful girl before
I have a friend coming over to visit tomorrow
I have books that I have reread several times
I have doubts about the success of their plan
I have no intention of telling you the result
I have some powerful friends who can help you
I have to deliver this package to Tom Jackson
I just wanted to make sure everyone was awake
I met her by chance at a restaurant yesterday
I never see you without thinking of my father
I often spend my free time listening to music
I really wish I knew who painted this picture
I regret not having studied hard for the test
I spoke loudly so that everyone could hear me
I teach French at a nearby junior high school
I think that I should organize a little party
I thought your dad took away your credit card
I trust the room will be to your satisfaction
I wish that we could spend more time together
I would like to read some books about Lincoln
It is important for old people to stay strong
It started raining just as I was leaving home

She is no less charming than her older sister
She lost her only son in the traffic accident
She sat there silently with tears in her eyes
She seems to be nervous about her first class
She spends a lot of time practicing the piano
She talked him into buying her a diamond ring
She volunteered to go to the meeting with him
She was determined never to talk to him again
She was more beautiful than all of the others
She was supposed to attend the party with him
She will give her picture to whoever wants it

You can see the ancient ruins in the distance

She suggested that the customer buy a blue tie
She talked on and on about her family problems
She was always ready to help people in trouble

He cried as if he were a boy of six
He is not the shy boy he used to be
He went so far as to call me a liar
I aim to be a doctor when I grow up
I can do it if you give me a chance
I have a lot of bills I have to pay

I want to go back to the way it was

An old man sat next to me on the bus
He is not the man that he used to be
I asked her to go to a movie with me
I make it a rule not to stay up late
I think I can do it in my spare time
I traded in my old car for a new one
I want you to tell me how to do this
I went for a walk to try to sober up
It is up to you to decide what to do
This kind of book is of no use to us
All I ask is that you show up on time
All you have to do is to do your best
He asked me if I could do him a favor
He asked me to go to a movie with him
I felt I just had to get off the ship
I get a call from her once in a while
I have a new camera I want you to see
I have to go on a diet to lose weight
I just wanted to see if I could do it
I know a very good way to get it done

I want you to help me get out of here
I want you to run to the store for me
I went to sleep as soon as I got home
I wish I had more time to talk to her
I wish I had more time to talk to you
It is bold of you to say such a thing
It was sweet of you to do this for us
We had to make the best of a bad deal
We have to take it one step at a time
What I want to know is how to do this
You remind me of a boy I used to know
He came at me with a knife in his hand
He does not know what it is to be poor
He gave me all the money he had on him
He has made up his mind to buy the car
He says he has a bone to pick with you
I do not even know what to say to that
I feel the same way about it as you do
I got to know him when I was a student
I had a crush on you when I was twelve
I have had to stay in bed for two days
I have no wish to live in a large city
I just want you to know how sorry I am
I made a list of things I needed to do
I met one of my friends on my way home
I ran into a friend of mine on the bus

I saw his car make a turn to the right

I will go and take a look at the house
It is wise of you to ask me for advice
There are a lot of things I have to do
They left it to me to decide on a gift
This is a picture of the ship I was on
Tom reminds me of a boy I used to know
We had no choice but to put up with it
We have to find a way to get that done
We need to buy a new rug for this room
A car is a must for life in the suburbs
A little rest would do us a lot of good
All you have to do is fill in this form

Give me some time to let it all sink in
He was a great poet as well as a doctor

I am starting the year as sick as a dog
I am very glad to be out of high school

I cut my right hand on a piece of glass
I cut up all but one of my credit cards
I did the job to the best of my ability
I feed my dog meat at least once a week
I first met Tom when I was a little kid
I gave up on the idea of buying a house
I got out of bed and had a good stretch
I got sucked in on a lot of phony deals
I had a cup of tea to keep myself awake
I had a fender bender on my way to work
I had no choice but to do what he asked
I have a very sore arm where you hit me
I hope we will be able to keep in touch
I hope you had a good time at the party
I just did what the boss asked me to do
I just want to improve as much as I can
I just want to sleep in a nice soft bed
I just want you to tell me why you lied
I plan to leave Boston as soon as I can

I want you to tell me who gave you that
I was caught in a shower on my way home
I was caught in the rain on my way home
I was the one who had to make it happen
I will come and see you when I get well
I will return the book as soon as I can
I wish I could go to the party with you
I wish I had more time to talk with her
It has been a long time since I saw him
It is easy for a monkey to climb a tree
It is not easy to get rid of bad habits
It took her a long time to choose a hat
My son came to see me from time to time
Now is a great time to buy one of those
People always ask me why I do what I do
She will do her best to be here on time
That boy talks as if he were a grown up
We have a lot of great guys on our team
What a fool I was to lend him the money
A jack of all trades is a master of none
A lot of people feel the same way you do
A man is more or less what he looks like
A museum is a great place to find a date
Give me a chance to make you proud of me
He fell down on the ice and hurt his leg
He is not as lazy a student as you think
He is said to have made a fortune in oil
He is too much of a coward to attempt it
He left the room as soon as I entered it
He likes to go to the beach now and then
He made up a pretext for a fight with me
He saved her at the cost of his own life
He took off his coat and put it on again
He will do his best to finish it on time
I am going to stay with my aunt in Kyoto
I asked her if she could go to the party
I came early in order to get a good seat
I do hope you enjoy the rest of your day
I do not know who is good enough for him
I go to the library at least once a week
I had a snack before I went back to work
I had no idea of what she intended to do
I had to stifle my anger in front of him
I hate it when there are a lot of people
I have a few things I want to make clear
I have made up my mind to propose to her
I have no time to help you with the work
I have so many things I want you to know
I have to buy a new carpet for this room
I just had to see you guys before I left
I just want to be left alone for a while
I just want to make it home in one piece
I just want you to know that I regret it
I knew I wanted you the moment I saw you
I made a bet that she would win the game
I make it a rule to study math every day
I meet him at the club from time to time
I need your answer by the end of the day
I only hope we can get this done on time
I saw the light at the end of the tunnel
I think that what you need now is a kiss
I think we need to find out where Tom is
I told her what he was doing in her room
I told him to work hard or he would fail
I tried to take our dog out of our house
I want Tom to go get me something to eat
I want to ask them when their big day is
I want to give you the chance to do that
I want to see you in my office right now
I want to sort this out once and for all
I want you to stay here until I get back
I want your answer by the end of the day
I wish I could live in a house that nice
I wish I had a roommate to hang out with
I would like to be a pilot in the future
I would like to talk to him face to face
I would love to go to the dance with you
It cost a lot of money to repair the car
It is said that there is no life on Mars
It was foolish of him to do such a thing
It was near the river that I lost my way
It was not easy for us to find his house
Let me say a few words by way of apology
Mary told me that she was glad to see me
On my way to the library I met my friend
She took a job in a store for the summer
The fact is that I have no money with me
The food was so good that I ate too much
The guy who hit you is at the front door
Tom is one of the few people I can trust
Tom tied the canoe to the top of his car
We must make up for the loss in some way
We must pay a toll to drive on this road
You should be able to walk in a few days
A well is a place where you can get water
All I want to do is finish what I started
All you have to do is sign your name here
Do whatever it is that he tells you to do
He does not need a wife to look after him
He fed his dog at the same time every day
He knows how to make good use of his time
He must be very angry to say such a thing
He seems to have been ill for a long time
He stayed at a hotel for a couple of days
He used to get up early when he was young
I am not used to staying up late at night
I am what I am today thanks to my parents
I asked Tom why he wanted to go to Boston
I do hope you will come and visit us soon
I had a glass of beer to quench my thirst
I have a lot of work to get through today
I have been to the airport to see him off
I have been to the station to see him off
I have known Tom since I was a little boy
I have not had a chance to see that movie
I have not heard from him for a long time
I have only half as many books as he does
I have the same number of books as he has
I have to take some money out of the bank
I just kind of want to be alone right now
I just want life to be like it was before
I just want to go over this one more time
I learned how to use a hammer from my dad
I let him sleep at my house for the night
I must work hard to make up for lost time
I need to go back to Boston for a funeral
I often wrote to her when I was a student
I saw your cousin Tom just a few days ago
I stopped off at Osaka on my way to Tokyo
I thought Tom told you what you had to do
I wake up at half past six in the morning
I want a box three times as large as this
I want to give you enough time to do that
I want to go over it again in more detail
I want to grow up to be a great scientist
I want to stay in America for a few years
I was about to go out when the phone rang
I was really tired so I went to bed early
I went to see a movie with Tom after work
It is not known when he came up to London
It seems as if you are the first one here
Let me know if I need to make any changes
Let me know if there is anything I can do
Let me know the result as soon as you can
Let me think it over for a couple of days
My father has been out of work for a year
My plan for the summer is to go to Europe
My uncle has a glass eye and a wooden leg
No one ate any of the cookies that I made
She has a tattoo of a lizard on her thigh
She is not so much a singer as a comedian
She is the one who took care of his wound
She may have left her car key in her room
She took her ring off and threw it at him
She went into the room and lay on the bed
That sounds a lot easier to do than it is
The point of play is that it has no point
There is a big stack of mail on the table
There is a park in the middle of the city
There is a pond in the middle of the park
They seem to have had a good time in Rome
This is the book I want to give my mother
Tom bought a box of candy to give to Mary
Tom came to my office to ask me for money
We had no choice except to put up with it
We have to make sure we get there on time
You can pick up a lot of words by reading
You do not want to incur the wrath of God
You seem to be in such a nasty mood today
A bunch of people told me not to eat there
A fire broke out in the middle of the city
A lot of people feel the same way Tom does
A stranger came up to me and asked the way
All of us want to live as long as possible
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
All you have to do is push this red button
Flip to the back of the book for the index
He does not even know how to sign his name
He has not written to them for a long time
He helped an old lady get up from her seat
He is going to buy a new bicycle next week
He is much better than me at the high jump
He ran as fast as his legs could carry him
He that will steal an egg will steal an ox
He turned off the light and he went to bed
He walked away with a sad look on his face
He would sit and look at the sea for hours
I can lend you some money if you need some
I can tell by his accent that he is German
I eat lunch here two or three times a week
I found a rare book I had been looking for
I gave him what little money I had with me
I get a lot of satisfaction out of my work
I had no idea you knew how to play mahjong
I had the same problem when I was your age
I have been waiting for an hour and a half
I have something that I want to say to him
I have ten times as many books as you have
I have to make the best of that small room
I have to talk with him about the new plan
I hope I can manage to make both ends meet
I hope you will have a good time in Europe
I just wanted to tell you how pleased I am
I knew all along that he was telling a lie
I love him more than any of the other boys
I met my teacher on the way to the station
I read this book when I was in high school
I refuse to be treated like a slave by you
I used to play tennis when I was a student
I want to stay in a hotel near the airport
I want you all to be on your best behavior
I was at the hospital a couple of days ago
I was in the right place at the right time
I was not conscious of a man looking at me
I will be through with the book in no time
I will tell her what to say at the meeting
It so happened that I had no money with me
It was a vase that my son broke last night
It was hard for me to turn down his demand
It was stupid of me to make such a mistake
It would be better for you to speak to him
It would be nice if you helped me a little
Look at the picture at the top of the page
My sister asked me to teach her how to ski
My uncle comes to see me from time to time
No one seems to know what this is used for
No sooner had he said it than he was sorry
Not a single star could be seen in the sky
Please take care of my dog while I am away
She asked me to pick her up at the station
She looked at him with a smile on her face
She told me that I could sleep on the sofa
She was advised by him to go to the police
She will grow up to be a very good pianist
Thank you for all you did for me that time
The frost did a lot of damage to the crops
The ice was thick enough for me to walk on
The street our hotel is on is the next one
The thick fog made it hard to see the road
There are a lot of bad people in the world
There is a man waiting for you at the door
There is a tinge of red in the eastern sky
These shoes are too small for me to put on
Today you can get two for the price of one
Tom had no right to treat Mary like he did
Tom has what it takes to be a good teacher
Tom is one of the richest men in the world
Tom made a list of things he needed to buy
Tom paid the driver and got out of the cab
Tom went back to his own room and lay down
Tom will never know it was you who told me
Try these shoes on and see if they fit you
We are looking for a nice house to live in
We had to make the best of our small house
We have to sing at an old folks home today
We tried to cheer him up by taking him out
We went to the café that I told you about
You are an idiot to go out in this weather
You have no idea how much that means to me
You have to make up the time you have lost
You look a lot like someone I used to know
You promised not to be rude to me any more
You told us she was kind and she really is
A lot of people were killed in World War II
A young man is singing in front of the door
All of my students call me by my first name
At the foot of the hill is a beautiful lake
Bad weather upset our plans to go on a hike
He added a little sugar and milk to his tea
He applied for a job with the Bank of Tokyo
He became sick and they laid him on a bench
He chose the wrong man to pick a fight with
He had the good fortune to find a good wife
He is a man whose heart is filled with hope
He is furious at what they have done to him
He is one of the best brains in our country
He is said to have taken part in the battle
He is the tallest man that I have ever seen
He needs a few jokes to lighten up his talk
He ought to have arrived in New York by now
He told me that he would start the next day
He tried with all his might to lift the box
He was at the wrong place at the wrong time
He was in the right place at the right time
He was silent for what seemed to me an hour
He was so tired that he fell right to sleep
He was walking up the hill at a steady pace
He will never give in even when he is wrong
I am in agreement with most of what he says
I am in no position to do anything about it
I am sorry that I have troubled you so much
I am sorry to have kept you waiting so long
I am very sorry to inform you that she died
I can never stay angry at Tom for very long
I can not feel at home in a luxurious hotel
I get goose bumps when I see a horror movie
I got to know her through one of my friends
I have a friend waiting for me in the lobby
I have a lot of money in my savings account
I have a lot of things to do this afternoon
I have five times as many stamps as he does
I have no idea why he quit his job suddenly
I have no more than one hundred yen with me
I have not been sick for the past ten years
I have three times as many books as he does
I have to finish up some things before I go
I have to think about what needs to be done
I hear his business is on the verge of ruin
I hope to continue to see more of the world
I hope to see reindeer on my trip to Sweden
I just want to know why you brought me here
I just want to talk with you a little while
I know Tom wants us to go swimming with him
I missed you a lot while you were in Boston
I need a pair of scissors to cut this paper
I plan to finish it in two or three minutes
I prefer soap as a liquid rather than a bar
I sat behind a very tall man in the theater
I see you had to work late again last night
I talked my wife out of buying a new carpet
I think there are lots of sites to see here
I took a taxi from the station to the hotel
I turned on the radio to listen to the news
I used to go ice fishing when I was younger
I want to ask you about the money you found
I want to know if you will be free tomorrow
I want to learn to play the guitar like you
I want you to come work here at our company
I was the only one not invited to the party
I watched a movie with my friend in my room
I went to see a movie with Tom after school
I wish I had eaten lunch before I came here
I wonder why they left my name off the list
It cost me a fortune to get my car repaired
It is not necessary for you to quit the job
It is said that the taste of love is bitter
It seems to me that she is a little selfish
It was in Tokyo that I first met her father
It was stupid of him to turn down her offer
It was stupid of him to turn down his offer
Kansas is smack dab in the middle of the US
My brother wants to go to the moon some day
My father spends a lot of time on his hobby
My son always gets sick when he rides a bus
No one I know can afford to eat out anymore
Our problem is how to get in touch with him
Please give me a piece of paper to write on
She as well as her friends is fond of music
She could not get over her fear of the dark
She had no sooner seen me than she ran away
She is coming home at the end of this month
She told me that she had bigger fish to fry
She warned him not to go out at night alone
She was advised by him to come back at once
That is the exactly the same idea as I have
That just goes to prove that you are a liar
The cow gave birth to a calf with two heads
The job of a driver is harder than it looks
The man you met at the station is my father
The paper says that a typhoon is on its way
The sum of two plus three plus four is nine
The trouble is that I have no money with me
There is no way to confirm that he is alive
There was a cottage on the side of the hill
Tom asked me to pick Mary up at the airport
Tom is the only one not invited to my party
Tom made a list of places he wants to visit
Tom put a star on top of the Christmas tree
Tom put down his spoon and picked up a fork
Tom turned over a new leaf when he met Mary
We arrived to find a huge meal ready for us
We had to call off the game because of rain
We lost sight of them over half an hour ago
You can stay here as long as you keep quiet
You cooked the steak just the way I like it
You may stay here as long as you keep quiet
You never know what you can do till you try
You ought not to call at this time of night
You remind me of myself when I was your age
Your wife is going to ask you for a divorce
A good pair of glasses will help you to read
A man whose wife is dead is called a widower
All the floors in her house are made of wood
Be sure to put out the fire before you leave
Give me back the book after you have read it
Happy is the man who is content with his lot
He asked his father to take him to the store
He asked his wife if she was coming with him
He asked me who I thought would win the race
He crushed the sheet of paper up into a ball
He fell in love with the girl at first sight
He has a bookstore in the center of the city
He has just as many books as his father does
He is taller than any other boy in his class
He is the last person to speak ill of others
He put up a notice about the change in price
He says that he has no memory of the evening
He tried harder to get good marks than I did
He was moved to tears when he heard the news
He was sitting in the library when I saw him
He was the only one not invited to the party
He was very naughty when he was a little boy
He went for a swim in the lake every morning
He wore a mask so no one would recognize him
Her house is on the other side of the bridge
His new book is going to come out next month
I am more than grateful to you for your help
I am staying at the hotel for the time being
I am sure that he will become a great singer
I caught him by the arm before he could fall
I found the book I had long been looking for
I go to the museum whenever I get the chance
I had no idea you could speak French so well
I had the same thing happen to me last month
I had to walk here because my car broke down
I have a feeling you might want to see these
I have plenty of things to eat in the pantry
I have too many things on my mind these days
I have two or three calls lined up for today
I heard voices on the other side of the door
I hope I will become a dentist in the future
I hurried in order not to be late for school
I left my baby in her care and went shopping
I lost the watch I had bought the day before
I must make up for lost time by driving fast
I opened the window to let in some fresh air
I plan to stay here until my money gives out
I put the meat we just bought in the freezer
I really have to think about this a bit more
I really need to go home and catch some zees
I saw the old man feed his dog chicken bones
I take a walk every day except when it rains
I think Tom drank out of my glass by mistake
I visited Rome for the first time in my life
I want an answer from you as soon a possible
I want this luggage taken to my room at once
I want to speak to whoever is in charge here
I wanted to thank you for what you did today
I was thinking about what she had said to me
I was told that I needed to get enough sleep
I was too embarrassed to look her in the eye
I will help you when I have finished my work
I wish there were some cute guys in my class
I wonder if he can reserve the flight for me
I wonder what the future has in store for us
I would like to go to Austria to study music
It is no use arguing with such a foolish man
It must be really creepy to work in a morgue
My brother fell off a tree and broke his leg
My mother told me I needed to eat less candy
Nobody told me it was going to get this cold
On Sunday we were on the beach flying a kite
Please get all of your junk out of this room
She did not visit me on Sunday but on Monday
She has a bad habit of chewing on her pencil
She heard him cry in the middle of the night
She looked at him and knew that he was angry
She said that she had to be back before dawn
She was ready to give him back all his money
She went to the train station to see him off
Talking to him always puts me in a good mood
The car broke down on the way to the airport
The castle is on the other side of the river
The cause of the accident is not known to us
The dog was covered in mud from head to foot
The horse chafed at the bit put in its mouth
There are a lot of places to see around here
There are a lot of places to see in Hokkaido
There are not enough chairs for us to sit on
There is a chance that he will pass the exam
There is a small garden in front of my house
There is nothing like cold beer on a hot day
They say that he has been dead for two years
This is the best cake that I have ever eaten
This railing is not as stable as it could be
This seems like a good place to pitch a tent
This work is simple enough for a child to do
Tom and Mary cut classes and went to the zoo
Tom asked me if I would be home this evening
Tom could never make me laugh the way you do
Tom goes to bed at the same time every night
Tom has asked us to buy him something to eat
Tom has lived in Boston for more than a year
Tom is the legal owner of this piece of land
Tom told me that he wants to meet my parents
Tom tried to tell Mary what she needed to do
Tom wanted Mary to bring him a cup of coffee
Tom will thank me for this one of these days
We are working hard to make up for lost time
We go to the movies together once in a while
We had known him for five years when he died
We have to be willing to take the first step
We have to put off the game till next Sunday
We have to put right what we have done wrong
We must continue to study as long as we live
We regard him as the best player on the team
We study the past for the sake of the future
You are old enough to stand on your own feet
You could go back to Boston if you wanted to
You have no idea how important you are to me
You must not lose sight of your goal in life
You will be able to read this book next year
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link
A long train of camels was moving to the west
A lot of houses were washed away by the flood
A man who speaks the truth needs a fast horse
Any book will do as long as it is interesting
Come and see me when it is convenient for you
Going out in this rain is out of the question
He fetched a few cushions to prop up her head
He got into the habit of smoking in his youth
He got lost while he was walking in the woods
He is an honest man and will always remain so
He is not always in the office in the morning
He made an effort to get to the station early
He opened the window to let in some fresh air
He selected a pair of socks to match his suit
He told me that he would wait till I returned
He was going to leave the house when she came
He was kind enough to take me to the hospital
He was never to see his wife and family again
He was very scared when he saw this big snake
He went to see her while she stayed in London
He went to the post office to mail the letter
He will get his job back at the next election
He will have left here by the time you return
His aunt takes care of his dog during the day
His family and his doctor urged him not to go
I apologize for coming by at such a late hour
I asked her to make four copies of the letter
I bought a bottle of beer at the liquor store
I bought the novel on which the film is based
I can spot a bleached blonde from a mile away
I figured it was better not to go without you
I finally found out what was wrong with my TV
I found what I was looking for in the drawers
I got up early in order to attend the meeting
I had never seen so many squirrels in my life
I had never seen that kind of fish until then
I had to wait twenty minutes for the next bus
I have been reflecting on what you said to me
I have neither seen nor heard of such a thing
I have no will power when it comes to dieting
I have rather a busy afternoon in front of me
I have to be home tonight before it gets dark
I have to do my homework instead of going out
I hear she is going to get married next month
I heard that he gave himself up to the police
I just need a few hours to finish this report
I know better than to be believe such a rumor
I know the reason why Tom was angry with them
I like the mountains more than I like the sea
I lost the camera I had bought the day before
I may not be able to cope with those problems
I never thought I would find a woman like you
I often think about the place where I met you
I once saw a man walk barefoot over hot coals
I parked on the street in front of your house
I ran into an old friend of mine this morning
I think he is the greatest artist of the time
I think we can do this without any extra help
I thought that my father was going to kill me
I vowed that I would never speak to her again
I want to leave this city and never come back
I want to see you in my office this afternoon
I was about to leave my house when she called
I was absent from school because I had a cold
I was so excited that I could not fall asleep
I went to the hospital to have my eyes tested
I will come up with a solution to the problem
I will keep on smoking no matter what you say
I will look after your cat while you are away
I wonder where to hang the picture he gave me
I would be very grateful if you would help me
It is dangerous for you to swim in this river
It is like looking for a needle in a haystack
It is no use blaming him for the accident now
It is too difficult a problem for me to solve
It is very hard to live up to your reputation
It never occurred to me that I might be fired
It never occurred to me that I might be wrong
It seems that she is not pleased with the job
It was careless of him to make such a mistake
It was cheaper than I had thought it would be
It was not long before we met again by chance
Japanese love to soak in a hot tub before bed
Mary is one of the richest women in the world
Mother advised me to take a walk for a change
My father tried to teach us the value of work
My father used to read books to me at bedtime
My friend asked me if I was feeling all right
My friends dropped by to see me the other day
My son is going to leave for France next week
Our world is only a tiny part of the universe
Please send me a letter as soon as you arrive
Please turn off the light so that I can sleep
Please turn out the light so that I can sleep
She is now better off than when she was young
She is very nervous and is always ill at ease
She knew better than to tell him such a story
She sent me a present in return for my advice
She spends a major part of her income on food
She suggested that I go to the store with him
She was able to kill two birds with one stone
She was advised by him on how to stay healthy
She was born with a silver spoon in her mouth
She was the first one to pay attention to him
She went from place to place in search of him
She went outside to get a breath of fresh air
She went to see him in the hospital every day
She wrote to her parents at least once a week
Tell Tom that he needs to wear a tie tomorrow
The boy next door fell head first from a tree
The church is on the other side of the street
The man you see over there is a famous writer
The next meeting will be on the tenth of June
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself
The park is located in the center of the city
The potato was so hot that it burned my mouth
The shopkeeper went out of her way to help us
There are a lot of tall buildings in New York
There are lots of things I want to talk about
There were a lot of young couples in the park
There were no more than two books on the desk
They went on a trip abroad for the first time
Think it over and let me know what you decide
This car was so cheap that he could afford it
This is the palace the king and queen live in
This is true of adults as well as of children
This road will lead you to the center of town
Tom bent down and picked up a handful of sand
Tom has been talking on the phone for an hour
Tom is an old friend of mine from high school
Tom is just a little bit shorter than Mary is
Tom made quite a lot of money in his twenties
Tom opened the door and held it open for Mary
Tom was fatter three years ago than he is now
Tom will spend the rest of his life in prison
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong
Try to find out if everything he said is true
We all jumped into the water at the same time
We have a lot of English books in the library
We have far better things to do with our time
We should ask Tom what he thinks we should do
We will have lived here for a year next March
You can be pretty helpful when you want to be
You can skate safely on this side of the lake
You can stay in the extra bedroom if you want
You should cut up your meat before you eat it
A bad cold has kept me from studying this week
A bat flying in the sky looks like a butterfly
A good lie is easier to believe than the truth
A lot of people are dealing with hay fever now
A loud noise jolted me awake from a deep sleep
A team is only as strong as its weakest member
A truck was standing in the middle of the road
All of my friends got asked to dance except me
All the people who go to church believe in God
All you have to do is apologize for being late
At the end of the speech she repeated the word
Every boy and girl is taught to read and write
Everybody in the room let out a sigh of relief
Father took his place at the head of the table
He decided to give up smoking once and for all
He gave an excuse about why he had been absent
He is second to none when it comes to debating
He kept the invaders at bay with a machine gun
He picked up a mirror and looked at his tongue
He said he had come to Japan the previous week
He told me that he wanted to leave the company
He told me that he would visit Nara next month
He was delighted to know I had passed the exam
He was taken care of by a certain young doctor
He was the first man I interviewed for the job
He writes to me less and less often these days
Her hair was so long that it reached the floor
I asked the villagers many times to let me die
I can remember when you were just a little boy
I do not know the woman talking to our teacher
I figured a change of scenery might do us good
I folded my shirts and put them in my suitcase
I found it difficult to keep a diary every day
I got a useful piece of information out of him
I got up early enough to catch the first train
I had been making the same mistake all my life
I had my hair cut at the barber shop yesterday
I have a friend whose father is a famous actor
I have to check and see what the contract says
I hit the snooze button and went back to sleep
I never for a moment imagined that I would win
I often go swimming at the beach in the summer
I sat behind a very tall person at the theater
I saw Yoshida for the first time in five years
I stayed home all day instead of going to work
I suspect they water down the beer in that pub
I think they should put a heavy tax on imports
I think this must be the place where Tom lives
I think this tie will go great with that shirt
I want this luggage carried to my room at once
I want you to do something about it right away
I was playing a game when I felt an earthquake
I would rather walk than wait for the next bus
It is human nature to be bugged by such things
It is not easy to speak naturally on the radio
It is said that smoking is bad for your health
It must be nice to have friends in high places
It was one of the worst experiences of my life
It was such a boring speech that I fell asleep
It was the best thing that ever happened to me
My aunt lives in a lonely house in the country
My colleague filled in for me while I was sick
My dad thinks my boyfriend is a real whack job
My mommy and daddy will love me no matter what
My mother would freak out if she knew about it
News of the recent blast is all over the radio
No one can tell what will happen in the future
Paris is one of the cities I visited last year
Please lend me the video when you have seen it
Please turn off the light before you go to bed
Please will you close the door when you go out
She and I have about the same number of stamps
She combed her hair and bound it with a ribbon
She feeds her dog the same thing that she eats
She gave birth to a pretty baby girl last week
She had a blue dress on at the party yesterday
She is well known both in Japan and in America
She lost sight of her friend in the huge crowd
She made it plain that she wanted to marry him
She spends a lot of money when she goes abroad
She spent a good deal of money on her vacation
She started kissing him as soon as he got home
She suggested that I give it to him right away
She was advised by him to listen to her doctor
She was brushing her hair in front of a mirror
She was ready to help him with washing the car
Some guy named Tom said he was looking for you
That dog is exactly twice the size of this one
The army is in the north to protect the border
The bell had already rung when I got to school
The cause of death seems to be a gunshot wound
The child came aboard the plane in a good mood
The five of us stood in a circle holding hands
The game was called off on account of the rain
The girl was afraid to jump down from the roof
The ice is not thick enough to hold our weight
The main character dies at the end of the book
The man reading a paper over there is my uncle
The movie is now showing at a theater near you
The old man freed the little fox from the trap
The teacher told them not to swim in the river
The trouble with you is that you talk too much
The two girls wore the same dress to the dance
There is a bench in front of the train station
There was nothing but an old chair in the room
They saw us as they were getting off the train
They took a sample of my blood at the hospital
They were in the right place at the right time
This is the window which was broken by the boy
This one has a lot of advantages over that one
This song reminds me of someone I used to know
This train will get you there in half the time
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right
Tom and Mary are on good terms with each other
Tom and Mary are planning a picnic at the lake
Tom and Mary left Boston at the end of October
Tom asked Mary why she was buying so much food
Tom came on Monday and went back the day after
Tom gave them a general idea of what he wanted
Tom has been told several times not to do that
Tom just told his wife that he was leaving her
Tom learned how to swim when he was very young
Tom persuaded Mary to go to the party with him
Tom tried to convince Mary to dye her hair red
Tom wanted Mary to wait for him at the library
Tom will be absent today because he has a cold
We are going to have a party on Saturday night
We could go out together like we did last year
We have left undone what we ought to have done
We have no one but ourselves to blame for that
We lost no time in sending him to the hospital
We picked apples so we could make an apple pie
We promised to stand by him in case of trouble
We saw what looked like an oasis in the desert
We should not despise a man because he is poor
We were able to see the sunset from our window
You are the last person I expected to see here
You do not have to take your umbrella with you
You know where to find me if you need anything
You must not get off the train before it stops
You should allow an hour to get to the airport
You should receive them by the end of the week
Young men such as you are needed for this work
Your feet will lead you to where your heart is
A merchant is a person who buys and sells goods
A small car is more economical than a large one
A thief broke into the house to steal the money
A woman whose husband is dead is called a widow
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
Everybody in that family has a car of their own
Everybody knows that he lost his leg in the war
Fish such as carp and trout live in fresh water
Give me another couple of days to think it over
He came across this old coin in an antique shop
He devoted all his time to the study of history
He fell asleep at the wheel and had an accident
He is capable of running a mile in four minutes
He is living with his friend for the time being
He is the most obstinate child I have ever seen
He left his parents when he was eight years old
He looked back at us many times and walked away
He never fails to write to his mother every day
He smokes like a chimney and drinks like a fish
He was proud that he was selected by the people
He wishes he had gone to the theater last night
Her gray hair makes her look older than her age
His mother sat up all night waiting for her son
Hot lemon with honey is a good remedy for colds
I always have two cups of coffee in the morning
I appeal to you to contribute to the new clinic
I assure you this is about much more than money
I can remember when you were just a little girl
I have to learn many words and phrases by heart
I have to take some photos for my class project
I hope everything will turn out well in the end
I left my wallet at home on that particular day
I moved to England from Germany when I was nine
I notice the sale prices are written in red ink
I plan to study this afternoon after I get home
I saw a man yesterday eating from a garbage can
I saw some of the guests leave the banquet room
I suggested that we bring the meeting to an end
I think it natural for her to decline his offer
I thought you were supposed to be at school now
I want him to be informed about that in advance
I want those reports on my desk within the hour
I was bored because I had seen the movie before
I was deeply affected when I heard of his death
I was surprised at the news of his sudden death
I will be working on my report all day tomorrow
I will have lived here for ten years next month
I withdrew some money from the bank for my trip
I wore a hat yesterday because it was very cold
It has been over three years since I moved here
It is said that the poor are not always unhappy
It is said that treasure is buried in this area
It occurred to him that he should start at once
It occurred to me that my watch might be broken
It seems that he believes what he said is right
It takes more than one swallow to make a summer
It was not until yesterday that I knew her name
It was not until yesterday that I knew his name
It was not until yesterday that I knew the news
It was very sensible of him to reject the bribe
Let me know when you will arrive at the airport
Let me tell you about the origin of this school
Listen carefully to what I am going to tell you
Mary is going to open a gift from her boyfriend
Men were attracted to her like moths to a flame
My boss has the ability to read books very fast
Never put off to tomorrow what you can do today
Paris is one of the largest cities in the world
Please tell me which bus to take to go downtown
She advised him to walk instead of taking a bus
She brought him to our place to meet my parents
She held him tightly and never wanted to let go
She hurt her foot when she fell off her bicycle
She left me simply because I had a small income
She listens to him even though no one else does
She makes a point of going to church on Sundays
She stood transfixed as if she had seen a ghost
She studies as hard as any student in her class
She told me which clothes would be good to wear
She was clever enough not to be deceived by him
Some days seem to just drag on and last forever
That mountain is five times as high as this one
That was one of the biggest mistakes in my life
The bridge saved them a lot of time and trouble
The contents of the box are listed on the label
The doctor told her that she should take a rest
The drunk driver had to spend the night in jail
The girl went to school in spite of her illness
The girl who is dressed in white is my fiancée
The last part of the trip was across the desert
The majority of his income goes to pay his rent
The man who I thought was my friend deceived me
The tall man wore a pink carnation in his lapel
The time will come when you will know the truth
There is little hope that she will come on time
There used to be some big trees around the pond
There was only a little milk left in the bottle
This is a problem you have to solve by yourself
This is just a symptom of a much bigger problem
This is the guide who took us around the castle
This is the longest novel that I have ever read
This is the person I talked about the other day
This picture reminds me of when I was a student
This problem may be solved in a variety of ways
Those pants are a little too tight in the waist
Tom asked Mary who had been the first to arrive
Tom broke the rules and was kicked off the team
Tom fell asleep and missed the end of the movie
Tom got an emergency call and had to leave work
Tom has been teaching me how to play the guitar
Tom lived the high life until the money ran out
Tom may have been in Boston with Mary last week
We have to memorize this poem by the next class
We hope to reach the summit before it gets dark
We used to go to the movies on Saturday evening
What I was looking for was right before my eyes
What matters is whether you do your best or not
What you do is more important than what you say
You are not allowed to turn left on this street
You burnt a hole in my coat with your cigarette
You can go from Washington to New York by train
You may catch sight of our house from the train
You should not despise a man because he is poor
You will soon get used to the change of climate
A sneeze leaves your body at forty miles an hour
Anything that is too stupid to be spoken is sung
Anything the group decides is OK is fine with me
Close the door after you when you leave the room
Come closer and have a good look at this picture
Everybody is supposed to wear a tie at the party
Everyone is entitled to be moody once in a while
He began to work to get Congress to reduce taxes
He expected that their talk was going to be long
He gave us an essay to write during the vacation
He had not even spoken to the president about it
He had words with his friend and then struck him
He is our teacher and a person we should respect
He is working as a security guard at a warehouse
He returned home for the first time in ten years
He squashed the insect with the heel of his foot
He was determined to finish the work at any cost
He was smiling as if nothing had happened to him
He went on to demonstrate how to use the machine
He will have been working for five hours by noon
He will make a business trip to London next week
He wondered to himself why his wife had left him
Here is a list of things you should avoid eating
His birthday just happens to be the same as mine
His salary is double what it was seven years ago
I always carry a bottle of mineral water with me
I am counting on you to give the opening address
I asked Tom if he knew anybody who taught French
I ate lunch at around eleven because I was hungry
I cut my finger while trying to open the package
I have a friend whose father is a famous pianist
I have a friend whose father is an animal doctor
I have no will power when it comes to exercising
I just felt like hearing the sound of your voice
I kept him company while his wife was in surgery
I like to add basil to season my spaghetti sauce
I often visited the museum when I lived in Kyoto
I spend a few hours a day maintaining my website
I spent the whole evening trying to find my keys
I think you had better stick to your present job
I think you ought to pay more attention in class
I use the Internet as a resource for my research
I wanted to know where the voice was coming from
I will have spent all this money in three months
I wish him the very best in his future endeavors
I wonder what it is like to travel through space
It has been two months since my arrival in Tokyo
It is not necessary for us to attend the meeting
It looks like your luggage is on the next flight
It seems that Tom is unable to solve the problem
It takes a lot of electricity to power a country
It was not until yesterday that we knew about it
London is one of the largest cities in the world
Look and see how much the cash register rings up
Make sure you stick together so no one gets lost
Mary had been knitting for an hour when I called
My brother earns half as much money as my father
My father was about to leave when the phone rang
Please give me a pencil and some sheets of paper
Please let me pick up your sister at the station
Prizes will be awarded at the end of the contest
Shanghai is referred to as the Paris of the East
She advised him of the date for the next meeting
She dumped him because she thought he was a jerk
She followed him home to find out where he lived
She got all the more angry because I kept silent
She hid the secret from her husband all her life
She is no longer the cheerful woman she once was
She lost her father when she was three years old
She makes excellent meals in the blink of an eye
She pleaded with him to stay a little bit longer
She stared at him and that made him very nervous
She took off her glasses and put her contacts in
She used to wash her hair before going to school
She was able to solve the problem in ten minutes
She was asked to convince him to paint the house
The beach is an ideal place for children to play
The boy said that the taxi vanished into the fog
The door swung open and Tom walked into the room
The food at that restaurant is too greasy for me
The garden is separated from the road by a fence
The history of China is older than that of Japan
The job earns him half a million yen every month
The king and his family live in the royal palace
The lamp was suspended from the branch of a tree
The mayor presented him with the key to the city
The only thing that matters is that you are safe
The rocket ought to have reached the moon by now
The weather was so cold that the lake froze over
There are a lot of beautiful roses in our garden
There are seven men and four women in my section
There was a Brazilian girl in my class last year
They are hardly likely to come at this late hour
They are used to the humid climate of the summer
They came up with a plan after a long discussion
They say that you never get over your first love
They will tear down the old building in two days
This is by far the tallest building in this city
This is the largest temple that I have ever seen
This is the pen that he signed the document with
This part of the library is closed to the public
This rug was made without the use of child labor
This tastes a lot better than what I usually eat
Tom and I usually talked to each other in French
Tom and Mary spent the night out under the stars
Tom got out of the bathtub and dried himself off
Tom had his wallet stolen while he was in Boston
Tom is our oldest child and Mary is the youngest
Tom seems to be able to speak French fairly well
Tom was arrested as a suspect in a criminal case
We all knew that it would happen sooner or later
We all need to learn to deal with this situation
We are bound to each other by a close friendship
We are still clinging to the dreams of our youth
We demanded that she should make up for the loss
We have a lot of good restaurants here in Boston
We have to bring our teaching methods up to date
We hurried to the airport only to miss the plane
We need a large amount of money for this project
We pointed out to him the error in his reasoning
We rented an apartment when we lived in New York
We sat in lawn chairs and stared at the mountain
Winning a lottery is an easy way of making money
You can get from Washington to New York by train
You must accept the king of Spain as your leader
You promised me that you would take care of them
A doctor tried to remove the bullet from his back
A fallen leaf floated on the surface of the water
A gang of three robbed the bank in broad daylight
A poor rice harvest will get us into real trouble
A trip to Mars may become possible in my lifetime
All of the students have to wear the same uniform
Canada is really big and there are lots of people
Fill in this application form and send it at once
Get me all the information you can on this matter
He betrayed us by telling the enemy where we were
He confirmed that it was the wreck of the Titanic
He failed to become a cabinet member at that time
He has to have his blood pressure taken every day
He intimated that all is not well in his marriage
He is one of the greatest scientists in the world
He memorized that poem when he was five years old
He never fails to write to his mother every month
He never takes any notice of what his father says
He used a headache as an excuse for leaving early
He was elected to the Senate in the last election
He was one of the unsung heroes of the revolution
I am sorry that she is absent from the conference
I am surprised that she refused such a good offer
I copied a passage from the book into my notebook
I felt like singing loudly when the exam was over
I felt my hands shaking and my heart beating fast
I forgot my lunch and bought a sandwich at school
I found a pair of sunglasses by the swimming pool
I gave my sister a pearl necklace on her birthday
I have a friend whose father is a famous novelist
I have not had anything to eat since this morning
I have nothing to say with regard to that problem
I have the feeling you had something else in mind
I have to keep my mind on this important question
I hope we have better weapons than the enemy does
I just want to tell Tom before somebody else does
I managed to acquire the book after a long search
I need to find something to open this bottle with
I need to know everything that you know about Tom
I only have American coins in my pocket right now
I read in the newspaper that he had been murdered
I should go home before my parents start to worry
I think this project is moving on the right track
I think your father hoped you would go to college
I want my children to have the best of everything
I want some beautiful flowers to put on the table
I want to get Tom something nice for his birthday
I wonder what could have made him change his mind
I wonder why people always want to know the truth
I wrote a song about what happened here last year
It is extremely hot and humid in Bali in December
It never occurred to him that she would get angry
It never occurred to me that I might get arrested
It was raining heavily when I got up this morning
It was very hard for her to suppress her emotions
It will only take a moment to answer the question
My brother went to the United States to study law
My father goes to Sydney twice a year on business
Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today
Nobody cares how much the dinner is going to cost
One of my favorite tunes was playing on the radio
Our bike tour of the French Alps lasted two weeks
People are more educated now than they used to be
Please fill in your name and address on this form
Please turn off the light when you leave the room
Remember to mail the letter on your way to school
She advised him to talk about his life in America
She always lets her children do what they want to
She asked him to help her father clean the garage
She belted out tune after tune at the karaoke bar
She had forgotten her umbrella so I lent her mine
She helped her father with the work in the garden
She made up her mind to graduate from high school
She seems to have something to do with the affair
She warned the children not to play on the street
She was indignant at the way she had been treated
She was ready to help him with cleaning the house
She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen
She will make a business trip to London next week
Some birds are sitting on the branch of that tree
Take your shoes off before you come into the room
That house is the only one that survived the fire
That tower you see over there is the Eiffel Tower
That type of person almost never asks for a raise
The Kiso River is often called the Rhine of Japan
The accent of this word is on the second syllable
The actress said that she was engaged to a banker
The architecture in this part of the city is ugly
The boy who lives next door often comes home late
The egg is a universal symbol of life and rebirth
The green lampshade casts a warm glow in the room
The loss adds up to more than one million dollars
The mosque was torched in the middle of the night
The only thing that matters is that you are alive
The price of rice rose by more than three percent
The time will come when your dream will come true
The train had already left when we got to station
The whale shark is the largest shark in the world
There will be an energy crisis in the near future
This is longer than any other bridge in the world
Tom and Mary never took their eyes off each other
Tom asked Mary whether she planned to swim or not
Tom asked me for more money than he really needed
Tom could barely hear what Mary was trying to say
Tom had bruises all over his body after the fight

I plan to get a job as soon as I can
A bat is no more a bird than a rat is
He is not as well off as he used to be
I want to find a way for us to be happy
I want you to put in a good word for me
It was a fine day so I went on a picnic
I want a cup of coffee and I want it now
It is not easy to get rid of a bad habit
It is up to you whether to buy it or not
That is the sort of job I am cut out for
You can do it if you put your mind to it
A dolphin is no more a fish than a dog is
A man came up to me and asked for a match
He came to Japan when he was a boy of ten
I have not been able to find a job so far
I need to know who I have to give this to
It is very kind of you to come and see me
Tom was mauled by a dog when he was a kid
When I grow up I want to be just like you
I had to drop out of college and get a job
I need a lot of cloth to make a long dress
I wish you had done what I asked you to do
It is a pity that he has no sense of humor
It is impossible for him to do it in a day
It is not easy to find the way to the park
It is not my intent to hurt you in any way
It took us half an hour to set up the tent
Keep an eye on my bag while I buy a ticket

All of us went to the theater to see a play
All you have to do is to wait for her reply

He did his best to be in time for the train
He is going to be a doctor when he grows up
He was the first actor I had met in my life
Help me pick out a tie to go with this suit
I always have a lot of fun when I come here
I fear that I might not be able to help you
I had to beg my friends to come to my party
I just wanted to let you know I have a date
I need to have a word with you in my office
I owe it to my parents that I am so healthy
I ran as fast as I could to catch the train
I ran the risk of losing my job to help her
I suppose I could change a tire if I had to
I used to swim every day when I was a child
I want my money back and I want it back now
I want to go to the top of the Eiffel Tower
I want to thank you all for a job well done
It is crazy of you to put your life at risk
My wife is going out of town for a few days
One of you two is going to have to go there
The sea is to fish what the sky is to birds
The twins are as alike as two peas in a pod
Try on this new suit to see if it fits well
We try to go to Boston at least once a year
He is as smart as any other boy in the class
He laid on his back and looked up at the sky
He looked at me out of the corner of his eye
He saved the boy at the risk of his own life
He used a big piece of paper to make the bag
He was mad at me because I broke up with him
I am going to do it whether you agree or not
I am going to stay here for a couple of days
I am in the habit of taking a walk every day
I have cut up all but one of my credit cards
I hope to get away from Tokyo for a few days
I hope you can be a better father than I was
I just want you to tell Tom what you told me
I met a friend while I was waiting for a bus
I suggest you do your job and let me do mine
I want a hot shower before I go back to work
I was on the spot when he had a heart attack
It is cruel of him to say such things to her
Keep an eye on the child for me for a moment
Let me give you a lift as far as the station
She picked out a pink shirt for me to try on
The apple was cut in two by her with a knife
The date of the party is still up in the air
The truth is that he was not fit for the job
Trying to do such a thing is a waste of time
You could do this if you put your mind to it
Be sure to turn out the light when you go out
He had no money and so could not buy any food
He is always a step or two ahead of the times
He is not the sort of guy who gives in easily
He took a taxi in order not to miss the train
He will be angry to learn that she told a lie
His son has what it takes to be a good doctor
I always have to wear a tie because of my job
I am only too glad to help you with your work
I am surprised by a lot of the things he does
I asked Tom if I could talk to him in private
I got a letter from a friend of mine in Japan
I had too much to drink and I can barely walk
I have to go to the airport to meet my family
I make it a rule to take a walk every morning
I met him just as he was coming out of school
I no longer wish to be a part of this project
I really had to run for it to catch the train
I saw a movie for the first time in two years
I want to get married and I want to have kids
I want you to explain it to me in more detail
I was able to find the book I was looking for
I will write letters to you as often as I can
I would like to call on you one of these days
My father is going to make a trip to New York
Never did I expect to see her in such a place
Please just tell me what it is you want to do
She came very near to being run over by a car
She loved me in the same way that I loved her
The air is thin at the top of a high mountain
The ball hit him on the left side of the head
The boy dug a grave for his dog that had died
The first thing you have to do is take a bath
The young man put out his hand and I shook it
This is the house I lived in when I was young
This is the last place I want to be right now
This is the same type of car as my father has
This is the same watch that I lost a week ago
Tom grew up in a small town not far from here
Tom is the boy I told you about the other day
Tom knew it was wrong to do what he was doing
We were told by him to leave the room at once
What I really want to do is to get some sleep
You can sleep here for a while if you want to
You have to go the rest of the way without me
You must see to it that the cakes do not burn
A friend of mine came to see me during the day
All we can do is wait for the police to arrive
Any song sung in French puts me in a sexy mood
Books are to the mind what food is to the body
He explained his plan both to my son and to me
He knows quite well what it is like to be poor
Her only wish was to see her son one last time
His only wish was to see his son one last time
I came upon an old friend of mine on the train
I had been reading for an hour when he came in
I had to sip the coffee because it was too hot
I hate women who say that all men are the same
I have no choice but to eat what they serve me
I have no idea to what extent I can trust them
I like the smell of bread just out of the oven
I ran as fast as possible to catch up with her
I ran as fast as possible to catch up with him
I saw him go into the toilet a few minutes ago
I spoke to the boy who seemed to be the oldest
I thought Tom was going to take us to see Mary
I took my shoes off and put them under the bed
I used a ribbon to tie my hair into a ponytail
I want to have a talk with him about my future
I want you to take back what you said just now
I was bitten by a lot of insects in the forest
I was just about to go out when the phone rang
I was told that we have to bring our own water
I will go along with you as far as the station
I will go with you after I have eaten my lunch
I wish I had a little more time to finish this
I wish you had not told the story to my mother
I wish you would shut the door when you go out
I wonder if Tom ever took Mary up on her offer
It was quite easy for me to carry the plan out
Mary took out a loan in order to pay her debts
My father is so old that he is hard of hearing
My friend Tom has twice as many stamps as I do
She is trying to save as much money as she can
The boy could not find his way out of the maze
The new tunnel is twice as long as the old one
The only thing we could do was to bear with it
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west
There is a lot of pressure on women to be thin
There is a nice park in the center of the town
They are no more alike than a cow and a canary
Tom may come and visit me any time he wants to
We are not too young to tell what love is like
We have to figure out a way to make some money
You have to do this whether you like it or not
A bicycle will rust if you leave it in the rain
A captain is in charge of his ship and its crew
All that you have to do is to follow his advice
An old man was resting in the shade of the tree
Get a job so you can support your wife and kids
Get in touch with me as soon as you arrive here
Half of the people in the office took a day off
He is not man to lose heart at a single failure
He makes it a rule never to speak ill of others
He makes it a rule to take a walk every morning
He said that he had met her on the previous day
He was the sort of man you could get along with
He who lives by the sword will die by the sword
He will come back to Japan in the middle of May
I arranged for a car to meet you at the airport
I asked him not to play the piano late at night
I did everything I could to help Tom find a job
I find it hard to get up early on cold mornings
I had left the key in the office the day before
I had the feeling you were going to ask me that
I have to pull a ripcord to start my lawn mower
I looked Tom in the eyes and told him the truth
I saw Tom a few minutes ago and he looked tired
I saw a fishing boat about a mile off the shore
I saw her taking a walk in the park at midnight
I sent him a letter to let him know my decision
I think this medicine will do you a lot of good
I took it for granted that you were on our side
I want to know if my baggage is going to arrive
I will go there on foot or by bicycle next time
I wish that I could give you the money you need
It always takes time to get used to a new place
It is an advantage to be able to use a computer
It is in this room that the summit will be held
It took a long time for her to write the report
Let me introduce you to a new way of doing that
My dream is to lead a quiet life in the country
My dream is to make it as an actor in Hollywood
My sister has three times as many books as I do
No one in his class can run faster than he does
Not a sound was to be heard in the concert hall
One does not wear a red mini skirt to a funeral
Reading is to the mind what food is to the body
She asked him for some money to buy a new dress
She bought a shirt for him to wear to the party
She got him to do anything she wanted him to do
She had been sick for a week when I visited her
She obeys him no matter what he tells her to do
She wrote to him to tell him that she loved him
That child grew a lot in a short amount of time
That is the same umbrella as I found on the bus
That was the first time I had ever driven a car
The bus will take you to the center of the city
The money you give them will be put to good use
The police have few clues to go on in this case
There is a white line in the middle of the road
They started to sell a new type of car in Tokyo
This is a lot harder than I thought it would be
Tom can reach me at this number any time of day
We ate an early lunch while we were at the mall
We have no choice but to give up the whole plan
You will be all right again in a couple of days
A doctor told me that eating eggs was bad for me
A number of cars are parked in front of my house
A portrait of an old man was hanging on the wall
All the goods for sale are set out on the tables
He asked me if I had slept well the night before
He did not believe anyone had the right to do so
He drank a cup of tea and then asked for another
He has the habit of standing up when he is angry
He kept his sense of humor until the day he died
I advised him not to spend all his money on food
I could not catch as many fish as I had expected
I feel sort of dizzy and I feel like throwing up
I found the book which I had lost the day before
I got up early in order to catch the first train
I had to cancel my trip on account of the strike
I hear a lot of girls wear bikinis at that beach
I hope to have my car paid off by next September
I just wanted to say thank you for all your help
I met some friends while I was waiting for a bus
I often go out for a short walk just after lunch
I stayed in bed all day instead of going to work
I think we should ask Tom where he wants to live
I used to tell people I knew how to speak French
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help
I will have my sister pick you up at the station
I will never forget the day when I first met him
I will tell him about it when he comes next time
I wish I could figure out how to make more money
It does not matter to me whether you come or not
It is impossible for him to finish it in an hour
It is necessary to have a license to drive a car
It is not clear what the writer is trying to say
It looks like Tom was able to get what he wanted
It took them some time to get used to each other
It was just an accident that we met at the store
Keep an eye on my suitcase while I buy my ticket
Man is the only animal that can make use of fire
My friend told me that he had bought a new watch
No one seems to have the guts to do that anymore
One third of the friends I grew up with are dead
She advised him to stay in bed for two more days
She asked him if he was a student at this school
She is very shy and feels ill at ease at parties
She told me that she would go to Paris in August
She wanted him to say that he would pay the bill
That was the hardest thing I ever did in my life
The group was made up of six girls and four guys
The mail train lost most of its mail in the fire
The man driving the bus is a good friend of mine
The problem was that I had nothing to say to him
The time has come when I must tell you the truth
The tree was felled with one hard blow of his ax
There are more stars in the sky than I can count
They might pay me more if I could use a computer
This will be one of the best memories of my life
Tom and Mary both left the room at the same time
Tom asked Mary to go out to have dinner with him
Tom forgot to tell us not to drink the tap water
Tom put the first aid kit back where he found it
Tom showed Mary how to boil water in a paper cup
Two years went by before I could find a good job
We had not gone very far when it started to rain
We have to make sure that we never do this again
We saved a lot of time by going down Park Street
We were glad when we saw a light in the distance
You are free to do as you please with your money
You may take either the big box or the small one
A boy of seventeen is often as tall as his father
A good many people have told me to take a holiday
All of the apples that fall are eaten by the pigs
Both of us began to smile almost at the same time
He began his meal by drinking half a glass of ale
He gave me all the money he was carrying with him
He is not a patient but a doctor in this hospital
He is the only one of my friends that is talented
He laid down his pen and leaned back in his chair
He must be crazy to go out in this stormy weather
He said that he had told you to speak more slowly
He told us such a funny story that we all laughed
He tried with all his might to push the door open
He was in the habit of taking a walk after supper
He will not change his mind in spite of my advice
His sisters as well as he are now living in Kyoto
I am afraid things will take a turn for the worse
I am grateful to you for inviting me to the party
I am very happy that you have agreed to that plan
I caught a glimpse of him as he turned the corner
I expect him to get over the shock of his failure
I forgot I was supposed to bring a bottle of wine
I fully intend to do everything I said I would do
I hate when other people make me wait a long time
I know the boy who is sitting closest to the door
I like to spread honey on my toast in the morning
I must get my work done by the day after tomorrow
I only eat meat about three or four times a month
I repeated what he said exactly as he had said it
I stayed at home all day instead of going to work
I think the prices in this store are way too high
I think we can come up with better plan than this
I think you want this more than you want to admit
I took it for granted that you would come with us
I want to find somewhere I can sit down and relax
I want to keep doing this for as long as possible
I want to know when my baggage is going to arrive
I was ashamed of what I had done to my benefactor
I will see to it that everything is ready in time
I will wait for you in front of the radio station
I would like to see you before I leave for Europe
I wrote down his phone number on a scrap of paper
I wrote him a letter asking him to come home soon
It is difficult to shoot a bird flying in the air
It is very careless of you to leave the door open
It seems like the cat caught the scent of a mouse
It seems that you are not having a good time here
It took a whole month to break in those new shoes
It was at that very moment that the bomb went off
It was raining when I got on the bus this morning
It was wise of you to take your umbrella with you
It would be great if you could join us for dinner
Japan today is not what it was even ten years ago
My mother was so tired that she went to bed early
People say I look about the same age as my sister
Please be sure to take one dose three times a day
She advised him not to go out by himself at night
She goes to the beauty salon at least once a week
She got him to do everything she wanted him to do
She knows ten times as many English words as I do
She sat on the bed as her mother braided her hair
She tasted the cake to see if it was sweet enough
She told him that she had seen me there last week
She told me that her mother had bought it for her
She waved at me before she got on board the plane
She wrote to him to tell him how wonderful he was
That is the same umbrella that I found on the bus
The mere thought of it is enough to make me happy
The teacher has three times as many books as I do
The time has come for you to play your trump card
The village in which he was born is far from here
The woman managed the drunk as if he were a child
Tom certainly had a lot of time to think about it
Tom had the only pool in town with a diving board
Tom lives in a small town not too far from Boston
Tom will leave the company at the end of the year
We should get away from here as quickly as we can
We woke up very early in order to see the sunrise
You are the kind of guitarist I like to sing with
You can only come to China if you’ve got a visa
You should know better than to ask a lady her age
A great deal of energy is locked up in the nucleus
A new building is being built in front of my house
A room without books is like a body without a soul
A sprain like this should heal within a week or so
All the cherry trees in the park are in full bloom
Bring me a clean plate and take the dirty one away
Driving on a slippery road can lead to a car wreck
He confided in me things he would tell no one else
He got up and left in the middle of the discussion
He has given up smoking for the sake of his health
He is going to stay with his uncle for the weekend
He went to see her in the hospital every other day
His income is now double what it was ten years ago
I can assure you that honesty pays in the long run
I go to the office by bicycle except on rainy days
I have faith in your ability to do the right thing
I just thought you might want to go skiing with us
I just want to make enough money to feed my family
I just want you to know how much I appreciate this
I really need to go outside and get some fresh air
I think I must be leaving since it is getting late
I want guards posted here and I want them here now
I want to apologize for the way I acted last night
I want to find out if the warranty has expired yet
I was wondering if you were going to show up today
I wonder if I should talk to her about the problem
It is abnormal to have the heart on the right side
It is not easy to understand why you want to leave
It took me a couple of hours to solve this problem
It was difficult for us to decide which one to buy
Just observe your cat and you will get to know him
Lie on the bench for a while with your eyes closed
Life in prison is worse than the life of an animal
My cat likes it when I scratch her behind the ears
My mother is the first one to get up every morning
My parents sent me to fat camp when I was thirteen
My wife did not attend the party and neither did I
Oceans do not so much divide the world as unite it
People say that he is the richest man in this town
Satoru is the fastest runner out of the five of us
She is firmly determined to own a store of her own
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college
She was at a loss for words to express her feeling
She was happy to be introduced to him at the party
She waved both her hands so that he could find her
Tell me which of the two cameras is the better one
The bar was so smoky that my eyes started to sting
The best way to predict the future is to invent it
The day will soon come when man can travel to Mars
The last time I saw Tom he was walking on crutches
The other boys teased him when he got his hair cut
The prize money enabled me to go on a world cruise
The reason is that I want to be an English teacher
The smell of dirty socks makes me want to throw up
The spell was broken and the pig turned into a man
The tip of the spear was dipped in a deadly poison
Then the pen fell from my hand and I just listened
There is an old castle at the foot of the mountain
There was nothing that I could do but wait for him
They had been saving money for the trip for a year
This guidebook might be of use to you on your trip
This might be the last time we ever see each other
Tom goes to the barber less than four times a year
Tom handed the key to Mary and she opened the door
Tom intends to live in Boston for more than a year
Tom thought it would be a good idea to leave early
Up to that time he had been staying with his uncle
We all wondered why she had dumped such a nice man
We had no choice but to call the police last night
We must take into account the fact that she is old
You could count to ten when you were two years old
You have to look out for other cars when you drive
You have to study hard to catch up with your class
You must consider what kind of work you want to do
You never can tell what kind of job you might find
A beautiful woman was seated one row in front of me
A caged cricket eats just as much as a free cricket
A clear conscience is the sure sign of a bad memory
A fire broke out at the inn where they were staying
A large amount of money was spent on the new bridge
A lot of people are now trying to sell their houses
A plastic cup is better than one made of real glass
Actually it might be a good idea to start right now
Do unto others as you would have others do unto you
He called in to say he could not attend the meeting
He came to the United States as a boy from Scotland
He ditched the car in an alley and took off running
He had no sooner arrived than he was asked to leave
He hit the center of the target with his first shot
He is by far the best baseball player at our school
He is one of the most popular students in the class
He ran away from home three times before he was ten
He seldom reads an editorial and is not a book worm
He took a look at the newspaper before going to bed
He was very kind to invite me to his birthday party
He will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law
Her daughter has what it takes to be a good teacher
I expect you to give me an answer by this afternoon
I gave some of my old clothes to the Salvation Army
I get nervous when I speak in front of large crowds
I have been living in Rio de Janeiro for four years
I have to go soon because I left the engine running
I just heard that Tom and Mary are moving to Boston
I knew you liked me even though you never showed it
I received a letter from one of my friends in Japan
I suppose Tom told you what time he plans to arrive
I think I still have time for another cup of coffee
I think there is no point in trying to persuade him
I think we should be allowed to go anywhere we want
I took the liberty of calling him by his first name
I was careful not to say anything to make him angry
I was late for the meeting because of a traffic jam
I was wondering when you were going to tell me that
I went into the town in search of a good restaurant
I will never forget your kindness as long as I live
I wonder what Tom would do in a situation like this
I would like to give him a present for his birthday
I would like to leave this town and never come back
It took a long time to accustom myself to the noise
It would have been better if you had left it unsaid
My coworker really knows how to suck up to the boss
My doctor told me that I needed to lose some weight
My family went to the zoo to see pandas last Sunday
My money seems to disappear by the end of the month
Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body
She agreed with him that I should go to the meeting
She explained to him why she was late for his party
She finally managed to get a hold of her old friend
She had a good time talking with him about his trip
She hid the letter carefully so no one would see it
She waved her hand until the train was out of sight
She will surely be enjoying a hot bath at this hour
Take a look at the FAQ before you call tech support
Take an umbrella with you in case it begins to rain
Take your hat off when you enter a house of worship
The boy took off his clothes and put on his pajamas
The dirty boy turned out to be a prince in disguise
The hotel we stayed at last summer is near the lake
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
There is not much doubt about the cause of the fire
There was once a time when I could not trust others
They can produce the same goods at a far lower cost
They say that he is the richest person in the world
They stayed in the room with me for the whole night
Tom asked Mary what kind of books she liked to read
Tom saw the newspaper on the floor and picked it up
We are looking forward to going on a hike next week
We could see the lights of the town in the distance
We need to concentrate on coming up with a new plan
We need to remember to put some gasoline in the car
We ran out of gas in the middle of the intersection
We saw Tom talking to Mary in the park this morning
What you have just said reminds me of an old saying
You can adjust this desk to the height of any child
You should have told him about it while he was here
You should not have lent the money to such a person
A lot of people think that lawyers get paid too much
A professional thief can jimmy a car door in no time
A trip to America this summer is out of the question
A university job would give you a lot more free time
All the flowers in the garden died for lack of water
Finishing the job by Tuesday will be a piece of cake
He caught the first train and got there just in time
He demanded that I should pay the money back at once
He had a kind word and a pleasant smile for everyone
He tried to be brave while he was being held hostage
I always drink a glass of milk before going to sleep
I always have a good supply of tissues in my pockets
I always thought this would be the right thing to do
I am not quite sure if we can meet your requirements
I began to be afraid you would never come back again
I did everything in my power to protect her from you
I expect a subway station will be here in the future
I got up earlier than usual to catch the first train
I had hardly left home when it began to rain heavily
I had lunch with Tom at a restaurant near the office
I had no idea that you were having problems with Tom
I had planned to leave for New York the next morning
I love to spend time trying to put together a puzzle
I ran into an old friend of mine outside the station
I scribbled down his address in the back of my diary
I speak French to my father and English to my mother
I spent a week in Berlin living with a German family
I spent hours looking for the key that I had dropped
I think I should probably go home and get some sleep
I thought about giving my saxophone to Tom as a gift
I understand I can get a bus to Disneyland from here
I want you to tell me everything you know about that
I wanted to have a word with you about what happened
I was surprised to see so many people at the concert
I was wondering if I could take a vacation next week
I wish I had studied English harder when I was young
