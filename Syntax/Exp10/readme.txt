- After every epoch print few sentences,
    - Blue score computation, and printing on few sentences after each epoch

- Understanding Ankit code (50-60-70%), and evaluate

- Using the 2 transformers we have to get similar or better results

 > one epoch takes 1:30
 > transformer epoch takes 30 sec




- Objective of Ankit code
  > take input wrong grammer, output correct grammer

- draw arch diagram
- use data from m2 files (m2 -> tsv, tsv -> m2)
- Profiling


- Use m2 files to see how well it corrects grammer of standard datasets -- V IMP
- Use our transformer to do above
- Run ankit code on Scribendi and see results

- How about using it as translator
