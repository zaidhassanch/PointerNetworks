T001_sort               : Original code
T002_sort_alphabet      : Code for word sorting
T003_sortTwoNumbers     : Extention of T001 to vector of features
T004_sortTwoNumbers     : Cleaned up code of T003
T005_sort_alphabets     : Try to merge T002 and T005


PHASE 1: Sort scalars
================================
- I Sorted 10 numbers
- Then sorted 100 numbers

PHASE 2: Sort Vectors
=====================
- Added provision for vectors and sorted vectors w.r.t. sum of vectors

PHASE 3: Sort Words Alphabetically,
===============================================================
- use ascii code as features
- Now since I could sort sum of vectors w.r.t a criteria, I should be able to sort fixed length words
- Extend to words of any length < N,
  > append a special character at the end of the word which can be treated it as <a, or >z

PHASE 4:



PHASE 4: Sort Jumbled sentences
======================================
- Instead of simple ascii representation of words, use "embedding" representation of words
- This would enable better sorting
